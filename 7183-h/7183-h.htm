    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A preface generally begins with a truism; and I may set out with the
      admission that it is not always expedient to bring to light the posthumous
      work of great writers. A man generally contrives to publish, during his
      lifetime, quite as much as the public has time or inclination to read; and
      his surviving friends are apt to show more zeal than discretion in
      dragging forth from his closed desk such undeveloped offspring of his mind
      as he himself had left to silence. Literature has never been redundant
      with authors who sincerely undervalue their own productions; and the
      sagacious critics who maintain that what of his own an author condemns
      must be doubly damnable, are, to say the least of it, as often likely to
      be right as wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond these general remarks, however, it does not seem necessary to adopt
      an apologetic attitude. There is nothing in the present volume which any
      one possessed of brains and cultivation will not be thankful to read. The
      appreciation of Nathaniel Hawthorne&rsquo;s writings is more intelligent and
      wide-spread than it used to be; and the later development of our national
      literature has not, perhaps, so entirely exhausted our resources of
      admiration as to leave no welcome for even the less elaborate work of a
      contemporary of Dickens and Thackeray. As regards &ldquo;Doctor Grimshawe&rsquo;s
      Secret,&rdquo;&mdash;the title which, for lack of a better, has been given to
      this Romance,&mdash;it can scarcely be pronounced deficient in either
      elaboration or profundity. Had Mr. Hawthorne written out the story in
      every part to its full dimensions, it could not have failed to rank among
      the greatest of his productions. He had looked forward to it as to the
      crowning achievement of his literary career. In the Preface to &ldquo;Our Old
      Home&rdquo; he alludes to it as a work into which he proposed to convey more of
      various modes of truth than he could have grasped by a direct effort. But
      circumstances prevented him from perfecting the design which had been
      before his mind for seven years, and upon the shaping of which he bestowed
      more thought and labor than upon anything else he had undertaken. The
      successive and consecutive series of notes or studies [Footnote: These
      studies, extracts from which will be published in one of our magazines,
      are hereafter to be added, in their complete form, to the Appendix of this
      volume.] which he wrote for this Romance would of themselves make a small
      volume, and one of autobiographical as well as literary interest. There is
      no other instance, that I happen to have met with, in which a writer&rsquo;s
      thought reflects itself upon paper so immediately and sensitively as in
      these studies. To read them is to look into the man&rsquo;s mind, and see its
      quality and action. The penetration, the subtlety, the tenacity; the
      stubborn gripe which he lays upon his subject, like that of Hercules upon
      the slippery Old Man of the Sea; the clear and cool common-sense,
      controlling the audacity of a rich and ardent imagination; the humorous
      gibes and strange expletives wherewith he ridicules, to himself, his own
      failure to reach his goal; the immense patience with which&mdash;again and
      again, and yet again&mdash;he &ldquo;tries back,&rdquo; throwing the topic into fresh
      attitudes, and searching it to the marrow with a gaze so piercing as to be
      terrible;&mdash;all this gives an impression of power, of resource, of
      energy, of mastery, that exhilarates the reader. So many inspired prophets
      of Hawthorne have arisen of late, that the present writer, whose relation
      to the great Romancer is a filial one merely, may be excused for feeling
      some embarrassment in submitting his own uninstructed judgments to
      competition with theirs. It has occurred to him, however, that these
      undress rehearsals of the author of &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter&rdquo; might afford
      entertaining and even profitable reading to the later generation of
      writers whose pleasant fortune it is to charm one another and the public.
      It would appear that this author, in his preparatory work at least, has
      ventured in some manner to disregard the modern canons which debar writers
      from betraying towards their creations any warmer feeling than a cultured
      and critical indifference: nor was his interest in human nature such as to
      confine him to the dissection of the moral epidermis of shop-girls and
      hotel-boarders. On the contrary, we are presented with the spectacle of a
      Titan, baring his arms and plunging heart and soul into the arena, there
      to struggle for death or victory with the superb phantoms summoned to the
      conflict by his own genius. The men of new times and new conditions will
      achieve their triumphs in new ways; but it may still be worth while to
      consider the methods and materials of one who also, in his own fashion,
      won and wore the laurel of those who know and can portray the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us return to the Romance, in whose clear though shadowy atmosphere
      the thunders and throes of the preparatory struggle are inaudible and
      invisible, save as they are implied in the fineness of substance and
      beauty of form of the artistic structure. The story is divided into two
      parts, the scene of the first being laid in America; that of the second,
      in England. Internal evidence of various kinds goes to show that the
      second part was the first written; or, in other words, that the present
      first part is a rewriting of an original first part, afterwards discarded,
      and of which the existing second part is the continuation. The two parts
      overlap, and it shall be left to the ingenuity of critics to detect the
      precise point of junction. In rewriting the first part, the author made
      sundry minor alterations in the plot and characters of the story, which
      alterations were not carried into the second part. It results from this
      that the manuscript presents various apparent inconsistencies. In
      transcribing the work for the press, these inconsistent sentences and
      passages have been withdrawn from the text and inserted in the Appendix;
      or, in a few unimportant instances, omitted altogether. In other respects,
      the text is printed as the author left it, with the exception of the names
      of the characters. In the manuscript each personage figures in the course
      of the narrative under from three to six different names. This difficulty
      has been met by bestowing upon each of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> the
      name which last identified him to the author&rsquo;s mind, and keeping him to it
      throughout the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story, as a story, is complete as it stands; it has a beginning, a
      middle, and an end. There is no break in the narrative, and the legitimate
      conclusion is reached. To say that the story is complete as a work of art,
      would be quite another matter. It lacks balance and proportion. Some
      characters and incidents are portrayed with minute elaboration; others,
      perhaps not less important, are merely sketched in outline. Beyond a doubt
      it was the author&rsquo;s purpose to rewrite the entire work from the first page
      to the last, enlarging it, deepening it, adorning it with every kind of
      spiritual and physical beauty, and rounding out a moral worthy of the
      noble materials. But these last transfiguring touches to Aladdin&rsquo;s Tower
      were never to be given; and he has departed, taking with him his Wonderful
      Lamp. Nevertheless there is great splendor in the structure as we behold
      it. The character of old Doctor Grimshawe, and the picture of his
      surroundings, are hardly surpassed in vigor by anything their author has
      produced; and the dusky vision of the secret chamber, which sends a
      mysterious shiver through the tale, seems to be unique even in Hawthorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been included in this volume photographic reproductions of
      certain pages of the original manuscript of Doctor Grimshawe, selected at
      random, upon which those ingenious persons whose convictions are in
      advance of their instruction are cordially invited to try their teeth; for
      it has been maintained that Mr. Hawthorne&rsquo;s handwriting was singularly
      legible. The present writer possesses specimens of Mr. Hawthorne&rsquo;s
      chirography at various ages, from boyhood until a day or two before his
      death. Like the handwriting of most men, it was at its best between the
      twenty-fifth and the fortieth years of life; and in some instances it is a
      remarkably beautiful type of penmanship. But as time went on it
      deteriorated, and, while of course retaining its elementary
      characteristics, it became less and less easy to read, especially in those
      writings which were intended solely for his own perusal. As with other men
      of sensitive organization, the mood of the hour, a good or a bad pen, a
      ready or an obstructed flow of thought, would all be reflected in the
      formation of the written letters and words. In the manuscript of the
      fragmentary sketch which has just been published in a magazine, which is
      written in an ordinary commonplace-book, with ruled pages, and in which
      the author had not yet become possessed with the spirit of the story and
      characters, the handwriting is deliberate and clear. In the manuscript of
      &ldquo;Doctor Grimshawe&rsquo;s Secret,&rdquo; on the other hand, which was written almost
      immediately after the other, but on unruled paper, and when the writer&rsquo;s
      imagination was warm and eager, the chirography is for the most part a
      compact mass of minute cramped hieroglyphics, hardly to be deciphered save
      by flashes of inspiration. The matter is not, in itself, of importance,
      and is alluded to here only as having been brought forward in connection
      with other insinuations, with the notice of which it seems unnecessary to
      soil these pages. Indeed, were I otherwise disposed, Doctor Grimshawe
      himself would take the words out of my mouth; his speech is far more
      poignant and eloquent than mine. In dismissing this episode, I will take
      the liberty to observe that it appears to indicate a spirit in our age
      less sceptical than is commonly supposed,&mdash;belief in miracles being
      still possible, provided only the miracle be a scandalous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains to tell how this Romance came to be published. It came into my
      possession (in the ordinary course of events) about eight years ago. I had
      at that time no intention of publishing it; and when, soon after, I left
      England to travel on the Continent, the manuscript, together with the bulk
      of my library, was packed and stored at a London repository, and was not
      again seen by me until last summer, when I unpacked it in this city. I
      then finished the perusal of it, and, finding it to be practically
      complete, I re-resolved to print it in connection with a biography of Mr.
      Hawthorne which I had in preparation. But upon further consideration it
      was decided to publish the Romance separately; and I herewith present it
      to the public, with my best wishes for their edification.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      A long time ago, [Endnote: 1] in a town with which I used to be familiarly
      acquainted, there dwelt an elderly person of grim aspect, known by the
      name and title of Doctor Grimshawe,[Endnote: 2] whose household consisted
      of a remarkably pretty and vivacious boy, and a perfect rosebud of a girl,
      two or three years younger than he, and an old maid-of-all-work, of
      strangely mixed breed, crusty in temper and wonderfully sluttish in
      attire. [Endnote: 3] It might be partly owing to this handmaiden&rsquo;s
      characteristic lack of neatness (though primarily, no doubt, to the grim
      Doctor&rsquo;s antipathy to broom, brush, and dusting-cloths) that the house&mdash;at
      least in such portions of it as any casual visitor caught a glimpse of&mdash;was
      so overlaid with dust, that, in lack of a visiting card, you might write
      your name with your forefinger upon the tables; and so hung with cobwebs
      that they assumed the appearance of dusky upholstery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grieves me to add an additional touch or two to the reader&rsquo;s
      disagreeable impression of Doctor Grimshawe&rsquo;s residence, by confessing
      that it stood in a shabby by-street, and cornered on a graveyard, with
      which the house communicated by a back door; so that with a hop, skip, and
      jump from the threshold, across a flat tombstone, the two children
      [Endnote: 4] were in the daily habit of using the dismal cemetery as their
      playground. In their graver moods they spelled out the names and learned
      by heart doleful verses on the headstones; and in their merrier ones
      (which were much the more frequent) they chased butterflies and gathered
      dandelions, played hide-and-seek among the slate and marble, and tumbled
      laughing over the grassy mounds which were too eminent for the short legs
      to bestride. On the whole, they were the better for the graveyard, and its
      legitimate inmates slept none the worse for the two children&rsquo;s gambols and
      shrill merriment overhead. Here were old brick tombs with curious
      sculptures on them, and quaint gravestones, some of which bore puffy
      little cherubs, and one or two others the effigies of eminent Puritans,
      wrought out to a button, a fold of the ruff, and a wrinkle of the
      skull-cap; and these frowned upon the two children as if death had not
      made them a whit more genial than they were in life. But the children were
      of a temper to be more encouraged by the good-natured smiles of the puffy
      cherubs, than frightened or disturbed by the sour Puritans.
    </p>
    <p>
      This graveyard (about which we shall say not a word more than may sooner
      or later be needful) was the most ancient in the town. The clay of the
      original settlers had been incorporated with the soil; those stalwart
      Englishmen of the Puritan epoch, whose immediate ancestors had been
      planted forth with succulent grass and daisies for the sustenance of the
      parson&rsquo;s cow, round the low-battlemented Norman church towers in the
      villages of the fatherland, had here contributed their rich Saxon mould to
      tame and Christianize the wild forest earth of the new world. In this
      point of view&mdash;as holding the bones and dust of the primeval ancestor&mdash;the
      cemetery was more English than anything else in the neighborhood, and
      might probably have nourished English oaks and English elms, and whatever
      else is of English growth, without that tendency to spindle upwards and
      lose their sturdy breadth, which is said to be the ordinary characteristic
      both of human and vegetable productions when transplanted hither. Here, at
      all events, used to be some specimens of common English garden flowers,
      which could not be accounted for,&mdash;unless, perhaps, they had sprung
      from some English maiden&rsquo;s heart, where the intense love of those homely
      things, and regret of them in the foreign land, had conspired together to
      keep their vivifying principle, and cause its growth after the poor girl
      was buried. Be that as it might, in this grave had been hidden from sight
      many a broad, bluff visage of husbandman, who had been taught to plough
      among the hereditary furrows that had been ameliorated by the crumble of
      ages: much had these sturdy laborers grumbled at the great roots that
      obstructed their toil in these fresh acres. Here, too, the sods had
      covered the faces of men known to history, and reverenced when not a piece
      of distinguishable dust remained of them; personages whom tradition told
      about; and here, mixed up with successive crops of native-born Americans,
      had been ministers, captains, matrons, virgins good and evil, tough and
      tender, turned up and battened down by the sexton&rsquo;s spade, over and over
      again; until every blade of grass had its relations with the human
      brotherhood of the old town. A hundred and fifty years was sufficient to
      do this; and so much time, at least, had elapsed since the first hole was
      dug among the difficult roots of the forest trees, and the first little
      hillock of all these green beds was piled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus rippled and surged, with its hundreds of little billows, the old
      graveyard about the house which cornered upon it; it made the street
      gloomy, so that people did not altogether like to pass along the high
      wooden fence that shut it in; and the old house itself, covering ground
      which else had been sown thickly with buried bodies, partook of its
      dreariness, because it seemed hardly possible that the dead people should
      not get up out of their graves and steal in to warm themselves at this
      convenient fireside. But I never heard that any of them did so; nor were
      the children ever startled by spectacles of dim horror in the night-time,
      but were as cheerful and fearless as if no grave had ever been dug. They
      were of that class of children whose material seems fresh, not taken at
      second hand, full of disease, conceits, whims, and weaknesses, that have
      already served many people&rsquo;s turns, and been moulded up, with some little
      change of combination, to serve the turn of some poor spirit that could
      not get a better case.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as ever came to the present writer&rsquo;s knowledge, there was no
      whisper of Doctor Grimshawe&rsquo;s house being haunted; a fact on which both
      writer and reader may congratulate themselves, the ghostly chord having
      been played upon in these days until it has become wearisome and nauseous
      as the familiar tune of a barrel-organ. The house itself, moreover, except
      for the convenience of its position close to the seldom-disturbed
      cemetery, was hardly worthy to be haunted. As I remember it, (and for
      aught I know it still exists in the same guise,) it did not appear to be
      an ancient structure, nor one that would ever have been the abode of a
      very wealthy or prominent family;&mdash;a three-story wooden house,
      perhaps a century old, low-studded, with a square front, standing right
      upon the street, and a small enclosed porch, containing the main entrance,
      affording a glimpse up and down the street through an oval window on each
      side, its characteristic was decent respectability, not sinking below the
      boundary of the genteel. It has often perplexed my mind to conjecture what
      sort of man he could have been who, having the means to build a pretty,
      spacious, and comfortable residence, should have chosen to lay its
      foundation on the brink of so many graves; each tenant of these narrow
      houses crying out, as it were, against the absurdity of bestowing much
      time or pains in preparing any earthly tabernacle save such as theirs. But
      deceased people see matters from an erroneous&mdash;at least too exclusive&mdash;point
      of view; a comfortable grave is an excellent possession for those who need
      it, but a comfortable house has likewise its merits and temporary
      advantages. [Endnote: 5.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The founder of the house in question seemed sensible of this truth, and
      had therefore been careful to lay out a sufficient number of rooms and
      chambers, low, ill-lighted, ugly, but not unsusceptible of warmth and
      comfort; the sunniest and cheerfulest of which were on the side that
      looked into the graveyard. Of these, the one most spacious and convenient
      had been selected by Doctor Grimshawe as a study, and fitted up with
      bookshelves, and various machines and contrivances, electrical, chemical,
      and distillatory, wherewith he might pursue such researches as were wont
      to engage his attention. The great result of the grim Doctor&rsquo;s labors, so
      far as known to the public, was a certain preparation or extract of
      cobwebs, which, out of a great abundance of material, he was able to
      produce in any desirable quantity, and by the administration of which he
      professed to cure diseases of the inflammatory class, and to work very
      wonderful effects upon the human system. It is a great pity, for the good
      of mankind and the advantage of his own fortunes, that he did not put
      forth this medicine in pill-boxes or bottles, and then, as it were, by
      some captivating title, inveigle the public into his spider&rsquo;s web, and
      suck out its gold substance, and himself wax fat as he sat in the central
      intricacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But grim Doctor Grimshawe, though his aim in life might be no very exalted
      one, seemed singularly destitute of the impulse to better his fortunes by
      the exercise of his wits: it might even have been supposed, indeed, that
      he had a conscientious principle or religious scruple&mdash;only, he was
      by no means a religious man&mdash;against reaping profit from this
      particular nostrum which he was said to have invented. He never sold it;
      never prescribed it, unless in cases selected on some principle that
      nobody could detect or explain. The grim Doctor, it must be observed, was
      not generally acknowledged by the profession, with whom, in truth, he had
      never claimed a fellowship; nor had he ever assumed, of his own accord the
      medical title by which the public chose to know him. His professional
      practice seemed, in a sort, forced upon him; it grew pretty extensive,
      partly because it was understood to be a matter of favor and difficulty,
      dependent on a capricious will, to obtain his services at all. There was
      unquestionably an odor of quackery about him; but by no means of an
      ordinary kind. A sort of mystery&mdash;yet which, perhaps, need not have
      been a mystery, had any one thought it worth while to make systematic
      inquiry in reference to his previous life, his education, even his native
      land&mdash;assisted the impression which his peculiarities were calculated
      to make. He was evidently not a New-Englander, nor a native of any part of
      these Western shores. His speech was apt to be oddly and uncouthly
      idiomatic, and even when classical in its form was emitted with a strange,
      rough depth of utterance, that came from recesses of the lungs which we
      Yankees seldom put to any use. In person, he did not look like one of us;
      a broad, rather short personage, with a projecting forehead, a red,
      irregular face, and a squab nose; eyes that looked dull enough in their
      ordinary state, but had a faculty, in conjunction with the other features,
      which those who had ever seen it described as especially ugly and awful.
      As regarded dress, Doctor Grimshawe had a rough and careless exterior, and
      altogether a shaggy kind of aspect, the effect of which was much increased
      by a reddish beard, which, contrary to the usual custom of the day, he
      allowed to grow profusely; and the wiry perversity of which seemed to know
      as little of the comb as of the razor.
    </p>
    <p>
      We began with calling the grim Doctor an elderly personage; but in so
      doing we looked at him through the eyes of the two children, who were his
      intimates, and who had not learnt to decipher the purport and value of his
      wrinkles and furrows and corrugations, whether as indicating age, or a
      different kind of wear and tear. Possibly&mdash;he seemed so aggressive
      and had such latent heat and force to throw out when occasion called&mdash;he
      might scarcely have seemed middle-aged; though here again we hesitate,
      finding him so stiffened in his own way, so little fluid, so encrusted
      with passions and humors, that he must have left his youth very far behind
      him; if indeed he ever had any.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patients, or whatever other visitors were ever admitted into the
      Doctor&rsquo;s study, carried abroad strange accounts of the squalor of dust and
      cobwebs in which the learned and scientific person lived; and the dust,
      they averred, was all the more disagreeable, because it could not well be
      other than dead men&rsquo;s almost intangible atoms, resurrected from the
      adjoining graveyard. As for the cobwebs, they were no signs of housewifely
      neglect on the part of crusty Hannah, the handmaiden; but the Doctor&rsquo;s
      scientific material, carefully encouraged and preserved, each filmy thread
      more valuable to him than so much golden wire. Of all barbarous haunts in
      Christendom or elsewhere, this study was the one most overrun with
      spiders. They dangled from the ceiling, crept upon the tables, lurked in
      the corners, and wove the intricacy of their webs wherever they could
      hitch the end from point to point across the window-panes, and even across
      the upper part of the doorway, and in the chimney-place. It seemed
      impossible to move without breaking some of these mystic threads. Spiders
      crept familiarly towards you and walked leisurely across your hands: these
      were their precincts, and you only an intruder. If you had none about your
      person, yet you had an odious sense of one crawling up your spine, or
      spinning cobwebs in your brain,&mdash;so pervaded was the atmosphere of
      the place with spider-life. What they fed upon (for all the flies for
      miles about would not have sufficed them) was a secret known only to the
      Doctor. Whence they came was another riddle; though, from certain
      inquiries and transactions of Doctor Grimshawe&rsquo;s with some of the
      shipmasters of the port, who followed the East and West Indian, the
      African and the South American trade, it was supposed that this odd
      philosopher was in the habit of importing choice monstrosities in the
      spider kind from all those tropic regions. [Endnote: 6.]
    </p>
    <p>
      All the above description, exaggerated as it may seem, is merely
      preliminary to the introduction of one single enormous spider, the biggest
      and ugliest ever seen, the pride of the grim Doctor&rsquo;s heart, his treasure,
      his glory, the pearl of his soul, and, as many people said, the demon to
      whom he had sold his salvation, on condition of possessing the web of the
      foul creature for a certain number of years. The grim Doctor, according to
      this theory, was but a great fly which this spider had subtly entangled in
      his web. But, in truth, naturalists are acquainted with this spider,
      though it is a rare one; the British Museum has a specimen, and,
      doubtless, so have many other scientific institutions. It is found in
      South America; its most hideous spread of legs covers a space nearly as
      large as a dinner-plate, and radiates from a body as big as a door-knob,
      which one conceives to be an agglomeration of sucked-up poison which the
      creature treasures through life; probably to expend it all, and life
      itself, on some worthy foe. Its colors, variegated in a sort of ugly and
      inauspicious splendor, were distributed over its vast bulb in great spots,
      some of which glistened like gems. It was a horror to think of this thing
      living; still more horrible to think of the foul catastrophe, the
      crushed-out and wasted poison, that would follow the casual setting foot
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt, the lapse of time since the Doctor and his spider lived has
      already been sufficient to cause a traditionary wonderment to gather over
      them both; and, especially, this image of the spider dangles down to us
      from the dusky ceiling of the Past, swollen into somewhat uglier and huger
      monstrosity than he actually possessed. Nevertheless, the creature had a
      real existence, and has left kindred like himself; but as for the Doctor,
      nothing could exceed the value which he seemed to put upon him, the
      sacrifices he made for the creature&rsquo;s convenience, or the readiness with
      which he adapted his whole mode of life, apparently, so that the spider
      might enjoy the conditions best suited to his tastes, habits, and health.
      And yet there were sometimes tokens that made people imagine that he hated
      the infernal creature as much as everybody else who caught a glimpse of
      him. [Endnote: 7.]

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Considering that Doctor Grimshawe, when we first look upon him, had dwelt
      only a few years in the house by the graveyard, it is wonderful what an
      appearance he, and his furniture, and his cobwebs, and their unweariable
      spinners, and crusty old Hannah, all had of having permanently attached
      themselves to the locality. For a century, at least, it might be fancied
      that the study in particular had existed just as it was now; with those
      dusky festoons of spider-silk hanging along the walls, those book-cases
      with volumes turning their parchment or black-leather backs upon you,
      those machines and engines, that table, and at it the Doctor, in a very
      faded and shabby dressing-gown, smoking a long clay pipe, the powerful
      fumes of which dwelt continually in his reddish and grisly beard, and made
      him fragrant wherever he went. This sense of fixedness&mdash;stony
      intractability&mdash;seems to belong to people who, instead of hope, which
      exalts everything into an airy, gaseous exhilaration, have a fixed and
      dogged purpose, around which everything congeals and crystallizes.
      [Endnote: 1] Even the sunshine, dim through the dustiness of the two
      casements that looked upon the graveyard, and the smoke, as it came warm
      out of Doctor Grimshawe&rsquo;s mouth, seemed already stale. But if the two
      children, or either of them, happened to be in the study,&mdash;if they
      ran to open the door at the knock, if they came scampering and peeped down
      over the banisters,&mdash;the sordid and rusty gloom was apt to vanish
      quite away. The sunbeam itself looked like a golden rule, that had been
      flung down long ago, and had lain there till it was dusty and tarnished.
      They were cheery little imps, who sucked up fragrance and pleasantness out
      of their surroundings, dreary as these looked; even as a flower can find
      its proper perfume in any soil where its seed happens to fall. The great
      spider, hanging by his cordage over the Doctor&rsquo;s head, and waving slowly,
      like a pendulum, in a blast from the crack of the door, must have made
      millions and millions of precisely such vibrations as these; but the
      children were new, and made over every day, with yesterday&rsquo;s weariness
      left out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl, however, was the merrier of the two. It was quite
      unintelligible, in view of the little care that crusty Hannah took of her,
      and, moreover, since she was none of your prim, fastidious children, how
      daintily she kept herself amid all this dust; how the spider&rsquo;s webs never
      clung to her, and how, when&mdash;without being solicited&mdash;she
      clambered into the Doctor&rsquo;s arms and kissed him, she bore away no smoky
      reminiscences of the pipe that he kissed continually. She had a free,
      mellow, natural laughter, that seemed the ripened fruit of the smile that
      was generally on her little face, to be shaken off and scattered abroad by
      any breeze that came along. Little Elsie made playthings of everything,
      even of the grim Doctor, though against his will, and though, moreover,
      there were tokens now and then that the sight of this bright little
      creature was not a pleasure to him, but, on the contrary, a positive pain;
      a pain, nevertheless, indicating a profound interest, hardly less deep
      than though Elsie had been his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie did not play with the great spider, but she moved among the whole
      brood of spiders as if she saw them not, and, being endowed with other
      senses than those allied to these things, might coexist with them and not
      be sensible of their presence. Yet the child, I suppose, had her crying
      fits, and her pouting fits, and naughtiness enough to entitle her to live
      on earth; at least crusty Hannah often said so, and often made grievous
      complaint of disobedience, mischief, or breakage, attributable to little
      Elsie; to which the grim Doctor seldom responded by anything more
      intelligible than a puff of tobacco-smoke, and, sometimes, an imprecation;
      which, however, hit crusty Hannah instead of the child. Where the child
      got the tenderness that a child needs to live upon, is a mystery to me;
      perhaps from some aged or dead mother, or in her dreams; perhaps from some
      small modicum of it, such as boys have, from the little boy; or perhaps it
      was from a Persian kitten, which had grown to be a cat in her arms, and
      slept in her little bed, and now assumed grave and protective airs towards
      her former playmate. [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, [Endnote: 3] as we have said, was two or three years Elsie&rsquo;s
      elder, and might now be about six years old. He was a healthy and cheerful
      child, yet of a graver mood than the little girl, appearing to lay a more
      forcible grasp on the circumstances about him, and to tread with a heavier
      footstep on the solid earth; yet perhaps not more so than was the
      necessary difference between a man-blossom, dimly conscious of coming
      things, and a mere baby, with whom there was neither past nor future. Ned,
      as he was named, was subject very early to fits of musing, the subject of
      which&mdash;if they had any definite subject, or were more than vague
      reveries&mdash;it was impossible to guess. They were of those states of
      mind, probably, which are beyond the sphere of human language, and would
      necessarily lose their essence in the attempt to communicate or record
      them. The little girl, perhaps, had some mode of sympathy with these
      unuttered thoughts or reveries, which grown people had ceased to have; at
      all events, she early learned to respect them, and, at other times as free
      and playful as her Persian kitten, she never in such circumstances
      ventured on any greater freedom than to sit down quietly beside him, and
      endeavor to look as thoughtful as the boy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, slowly emerging from one of these waking reveries, little Ned gazed
      about him, and saw Elsie sitting with this pretty pretence of
      thoughtfulness and dreaminess in her little chair, close beside him; now
      and then peeping under her eyelashes to note what changes might come over
      his face. After looking at her a moment or two, he quietly took her
      willing and warm little hand in his own, and led her up to the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group, methinks, must have been a picturesque one, made up as it was
      of several apparently discordant elements, each of which happened to be so
      combined as to make a more effective whole. The beautiful grave boy, with
      a little sword by his side and a feather in his hat, of a brown
      complexion, slender, with his white brow and dark, thoughtful eyes, so
      earnest upon some mysterious theme; the prettier little girl, a blonde,
      round, rosy, so truly sympathetic with her companion&rsquo;s mood, yet
      unconsciously turning all to sport by her attempt to assume one similar;&mdash;these
      two standing at the grim Doctor&rsquo;s footstool; he meanwhile, black,
      wild-bearded, heavy-browed, red-eyed, wrapped in his faded dressing-gown,
      puffing out volumes of vapor from his long pipe, and making, just at that
      instant, application to a tumbler, which, we regret to say, was generally
      at his elbow, with some dark-colored potation in it that required to be
      frequently replenished from a neighboring black bottle. Half, at least, of
      the fluids in the grim Doctor&rsquo;s system must have been derived from that
      same black bottle, so constant was his familiarity with its contents; and
      yet his eyes were never redder at one time than another, nor his utterance
      thicker, nor his mood perceptibly the brighter or the duller for all his
      conviviality. It is true, when, once, the bottle happened to be empty for
      a whole day together, Doctor Grimshawe was observed by crusty Hannah and
      by the children to be considerably fiercer than usual: so that probably,
      by some maladjustment of consequences, his intemperance was only to be
      found in refraining from brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor must we forget&mdash;in attempting to conceive the effect of these two
      beautiful children in such a sombre room, looking on the graveyard, and
      contrasted with the grim Doctor&rsquo;s aspect of heavy and smouldering
      fierceness&mdash;that over his head, at this very moment, dangled the
      portentous spider, who seemed to have come down from his web aloft for the
      purpose of hearing what the two young people could have to say to his
      patron, and what reference it might have to certain mysterious documents
      which the Doctor kept locked up in a secret cupboard behind the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grim Doctor,&rdquo; said Ned, after looking up into the Doctor&rsquo;s face, as a
      sensitive child inevitably does, to see whether the occasion was
      favorable, yet determined to proceed with his purpose whether so or not,&mdash;&ldquo;Grim
      Doctor, I want you to answer me a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to your good health, Ned!&rdquo; quoth the Doctor, eying the pair
      intently, as he often did, when they were unconscious. &ldquo;So you want to ask
      me a question? As many as you please, my fine fellow; and I shall answer
      as many, and as much, and as truly, as may please myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, grim Doctor!&rdquo; said the little girl, now letting go of Ned&rsquo;s hand, and
      climbing upon the Doctor&rsquo;s knee, &ldquo;&lsquo;ou shall answer as many as Ned please
      to ask, because to please him and me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, child,&rdquo; said Doctor Grimshawe, &ldquo;little Ned will have his rights at
      least, at my hands, if not other people&rsquo;s rights likewise; and, if it be
      right, I shall answer his question. Only, let him ask it at once; for I
      want to be busy thinking about something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Doctor Grim,&rdquo; said little Ned, &ldquo;tell me, in the first place, where
      I came from, and how you came to have me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor looked at the little man, so seriously and earnestly putting
      this demand, with a perplexed, and at first it might almost seem a
      startled aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question, indeed, my friend Ned!&rdquo; ejaculated he, putting forth
      a whiff of smoke and imbibing a nip from his tumbler before he spoke; and
      perhaps framing his answer, as many thoughtful and secret people do, in
      such a way as to let out his secret mood to the child, because knowing he
      could not understand it: &ldquo;Whence did you come? Whence did any of us come?
      Out of the darkness and mystery; out of nothingness; out of a kingdom of
      shadows; out of dust, clay, mud, I think, and to return to it again. Out
      of a former state of being, whence we have brought a good many shadowy
      revelations, purporting that it was no very pleasant one. Out of a former
      life, of which the present one is the hell!&mdash;And why are you come?
      Faith, Ned, he must be a wiser man than Doctor Grim who can tell why you
      or any other mortal came hither; only one thing I am well aware of,&mdash;it
      was not to be happy. To toil and moil and hope and fear; and to love in a
      shadowy, doubtful sort of way, and to hate in bitter earnest,&mdash;that
      is what you came for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Doctor Grim! this is very naughty,&rdquo; said little Elsie. &ldquo;You are
      making fun of little Ned, when he is in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; quoth Doctor Grim, bursting into a laugh peculiar to him, very loud
      and obstreperous. &ldquo;I am glad you find it so, my little woman. Well, and so
      you bid me tell absolutely where he came from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie nodded her bright little head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, friend Ned, insist upon knowing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I do, Doctor Grim!&rdquo; answered Ned. His white, childish brow had
      gathered into a frown, such was the earnestness of his determination; and
      he stamped his foot on the floor, as if ready to follow up his demand by
      an appeal to the little tin sword which hung by his side. The Doctor
      looked at him with a kind of smile,&mdash;not a very pleasant one; for it
      was an unamiable characteristic of his temper that a display of spirit,
      even in a child, was apt to arouse his immense combativeness, and make him
      aim a blow without much consideration how heavily it might fall, or on how
      unequal an antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you insist upon an answer, Master Ned, you shall have it,&rdquo; replied he.
      &ldquo;You were taken by me, boy, a foundling from an almshouse; and if ever
      hereafter you desire to know your kindred, you must take your chance of
      the first man you meet. He is as likely to be your father as another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and his brow grew as red as fire. It was but a
      momentary fierceness; the next instant he clasped his hands over his face,
      and wept in a violent convulsion of grief and shame. Little Elsie clasped
      her arms about him, kissing his brow and chin, which were all that her
      lips could touch, under his clasped hands; but Ned turned away
      uncomforted, and was blindly making his way towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned, my little fellow, come back!&rdquo; said Doctor Grim, who had very
      attentively watched the cruel effect of his communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boy did not reply, and was still tending towards the door, the grim
      Doctor vouchsafed to lay aside his pipe, get up from his arm-chair (a
      thing he seldom did between supper and bedtime), and shuffle after the two
      children in his slippers. He caught them on the threshold, brought little
      Ned back by main force,&mdash;for he was a rough man even in his
      tenderness,&mdash;and, sitting down again and taking him on his knee,
      pulled away his hands from before his face. Never was a more pitiful sight
      than that pale countenance, so infantile still, yet looking old and
      experienced already, with a sense of disgrace, with a feeling of
      loneliness; so beautiful, nevertheless, that it seemed to possess all the
      characteristics which fine hereditary traits and culture, or many
      forefathers, could do in refining a human stock. And this was a nameless
      weed, sprouting from some chance seed by the dusty wayside!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned, my dear old boy,&rdquo; said Doctor Grim,&mdash;and he kissed that pale,
      tearful face,&mdash;the first and last time, to the best of my belief,
      that he was ever betrayed into that tenderness; &ldquo;forget what I have said!
      Yes, remember, if you like, that you came from an almshouse; but remember,
      too,&mdash;what your friend Doctor Grim is ready to affirm and make oath
      of,&mdash;that he can trace your kindred and race through that sordid
      experience, and back, back, for a hundred and fifty years, into an old
      English line. Come, little Ned, and look at this picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the boy by the hand to a corner of the room, where hung upon the
      wall a portrait which Ned had often looked at. It seemed an old picture;
      but the Doctor had had it cleaned and varnished, so that it looked dim and
      dark, and yet it seemed to be the representation of a man of no mark; not
      at least of such mark as would naturally leave his features to be
      transmitted for the interest of another generation. For he was clad in a
      mean dress of old fashion,&mdash;a leather jerkin it appeared to be,&mdash;and
      round his neck, moreover, was a noose of rope, as if he might have been on
      the point of being hanged. But the face of the portrait, nevertheless, was
      beautiful, noble, though sad; with a great development of sensibility, a
      look of suffering and endurance amounting to triumph,&mdash;a peace
      through all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; continued the Doctor, &ldquo;if you must go on dreaming about
      your race. Dream that you are of the blood of this being; for, mean as his
      station looks, he comes of an ancient and noble race, and was the noblest
      of them all! Let me alone, Ned, and I shall spin out the web that shall
      link you to that man. The grim Doctor can do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grim Doctor&rsquo;s face looked fierce with the earnestness with which he
      said these words. You would have said that he was taking an oath to
      overthrow and annihilate a race, rather than to build one up by bringing
      forward the infant heir out of obscurity, and making plain the links&mdash;the
      filaments&mdash;which cemented this feeble childish life, in a far
      country, with the great tide of a noble life, which had come down like a
      chain from antiquity, in old England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said the words, however, the grim Doctor appeared ashamed both of
      the heat and of the tenderness into which he had been betrayed; for rude
      and rough as his nature was, there was a kind of decorum in it, too, that
      kept him within limits of his own. So he went back to his chair, his pipe,
      and his tumbler, and was gruffer and more taciturn than ever for the rest
      of the evening. And after the children went to bed, he leaned back in his
      chair and looked up at the vast tropic spider, who was particularly busy
      in adding to the intricacies of his web; until he fell asleep with his
      eyes fixed in that direction, and the extinguished pipe in one hand and
      the empty tumbler in the other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doctor Grimshawe, after the foregone scene, began a practice of conversing
      more with the children than formerly; directing his discourse chiefly to
      Ned, although Elsie&rsquo;s vivacity and more outspoken and demonstrative
      character made her take quite as large a share in the conversation as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor&rsquo;s communications referred chiefly to a village, or
      neighborhood, or locality in England, which he chose to call Newnham;
      although he told the children that this was not the real name, which, for
      reasons best known to himself, he wished to conceal. Whatever the name
      were, he seemed to know the place so intimately, that the children, as a
      matter of course, adopted the conclusion that it was his birthplace, and
      the spot where he had spent his schoolboy days, and had lived until some
      inscrutable reason had impelled him to quit its ivy-grown antiquity, and
      all the aged beauty and strength that he spoke of, and to cross the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He used to tell of an old church, far unlike the brick and pine-built
      meeting-houses with which the children were familiar; a church, the stones
      of which were laid, every one of them, before the world knew of the
      country in which he was then speaking: and how it had a spire, the lower
      part of which was mantled with ivy, and up which, towards its very spire,
      the ivy was still creeping; and how there was a tradition, that, if the
      ivy ever reached the top, the spire would fall upon the roof of the old
      gray church, and crush it all down among its surrounding tombstones.
      [Endnote: 1] And so, as this misfortune would be so heavy a one, there
      seemed to be a miracle wrought from year to year, by which the ivy, though
      always flourishing, could never grow beyond a certain point; so that the
      spire and church had stood unharmed for thirty years; though the wise old
      people were constantly foretelling that the passing year must be the very
      last one that it could stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told, too, of a place that made little Ned blush and cast down his eyes
      to hide the tears of anger and shame at he knew not what, which would
      irresistibly spring into them; for it reminded him of the almshouse where,
      as the cruel Doctor said, Ned himself had had his earliest home. And yet,
      after all, it had scarcely a feature of resemblance; and there was this
      great point of difference,&mdash;that whereas, in Ned&rsquo;s wretched abode (a
      large, unsightly brick house), there were many wretched infants like
      himself, as well as helpless people of all ages, widows, decayed
      drunkards, people of feeble wits, and all kinds of imbecility; it being a
      haven for those who could not contend in the hard, eager, pitiless
      struggle of life; in the place the Doctor spoke of, a noble, Gothic, mossy
      structure, there were none but aged men, who had drifted into this quiet
      harbor to end their days in a sort of humble yet stately ease and decorous
      abundance. And this shelter, the grim Doctor said, was the gift of a man
      who had died ages ago; and having been a great sinner in his lifetime, and
      having drawn lands, manors, and a great mass of wealth into his clutches,
      by violent and unfair means, had thought to get his pardon by founding
      this Hospital, as it was called, in which thirteen old men should always
      reside; and he hoped that they would spend their time in praying for the
      welfare of his soul. [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Said little Elsie, &ldquo;I am glad he did it, and I hope the poor old men never
      forgot to pray for him, and that it did good to the poor wicked man&rsquo;s
      soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, child,&rdquo; said Doctor Grimshawe, with a scowl into vacancy, and a
      sort of wicked leer of merriment at the same time, as if he saw before him
      the face of the dead man of past centuries, &ldquo;I happen to be no lover of
      this man&rsquo;s race, and I hate him for the sake of one of his descendants. I
      don&rsquo;t think he succeeded in bribing the Devil to let him go, or God to
      save him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Grim, you are very naughty!&rdquo; said Elsie, looking shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fair enough,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;to hate your enemies to the very brink of
      the grave, but then to leave him to get what mercy he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After shoving him in!&rdquo; quoth the Doctor; and made no further response to
      either of these criticisms, which seemed indeed to affect him very little&mdash;if
      he even listened to them. For he was a man of singularly imperfect moral
      culture; insomuch that nothing else was so remarkable about him as that&mdash;possessing
      a good deal of intellectual ability, made available by much reading and
      experience&mdash;he was so very dark on the moral side; as if he needed
      the natural perceptions that should have enabled him to acquire that
      better wisdom. Such a phenomenon often meets us in life; oftener than we
      recognize, because a certain tact and exterior decency generally hide the
      moral deficiency. But often there is a mind well polished, married to a
      conscience and natural impulses left as they were in childhood, except
      that they have sprouted up into evil and poisonous weeds, richly
      blossoming with strong-smelling flowers, or seeds which the plant scatters
      by a sort of impulse; even as the Doctor was now half-consciously throwing
      seeds of his evil passions into the minds of these children. He was
      himself a grown-up child, without tact, simplicity, and innocence, and
      with ripened evil, all the ranker for a native heat that was in him and
      still active, which might have nourished good things as well as evil.
      Indeed, it did cherish by chance a root or two of good, the fragrance of
      which was sometimes perceptible among all this rank growth of poisonous
      weeds. A grown-up child he was,&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor now went on to describe an old country-seat, which stood near
      this village and the ancient Hospital that he had been telling about, and
      which was formerly the residence of the wicked man (a knight and a brave
      one, well known in the Lancastrian wars) who had founded the latter. It
      was a venerable old mansion, which a Saxon Thane had begun to build more
      than a thousand years ago, the old English oak that he built into the
      frame being still visible in the ancient skeleton of its roof, sturdy and
      strong as if put up yesterday. And the descendants of the man who built
      it, through the French line (for a Norman baron wedded the daughter and
      heiress of the Saxon), dwelt there yet; and in each century they had done
      something for the old Hall,&mdash;building a tower, adding a suite of
      rooms, strengthening what was already built, putting in a painted window,
      making it more spacious and convenient,&mdash;till it seemed as if Time
      employed himself in thinking what could be done for the old house. As fast
      as any part decayed, it was renewed, with such simple art that the new
      completed, as it were, and fitted itself to the old. So that it seemed as
      if the house never had been finished, until just that thing was added. For
      many an age, the possessors had gone on adding strength to strength,
      digging out the moat to a greater depth, piercing the walls with holes for
      archers to shoot through, or building a turret to keep watch upon. But at
      last all necessity for these precautions passed away, and then they
      thought of convenience and comfort, adding something in every generation
      to these. And by and by they thought of beauty too; and in this time
      helped them with its weather-stains, and the ivy that grew over the walls,
      and the grassy depth of the dried-up moat, and the abundant shade that
      grew up everywhere, where naked strength would have been ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One curious thing in the house,&rdquo; said the Doctor, lowering his voice, but
      with a mysterious look of triumph, and that old scowl, too, at the
      children, &ldquo;was that they built a secret chamber,&mdash;a very secret one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret chamber!&rdquo; cried little Ned; &ldquo;who lived in it? A ghost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was often use for it,&rdquo; said Doctor Grim; &ldquo;hiding people who had
      fought on the wrong side, or Catholic priests, or criminals, or perhaps&mdash;who
      knows?&mdash;enemies that they wanted put out of the way,&mdash;troublesome
      folks. Ah! it was often of use, that secret chamber: and is so still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Doctor paused a long while, and leaned back in his chair, slowly
      puffing long whiffs from his pipe, looking up at the great spider-demon
      that hung over his head, and, as it seemed to the children by the
      expression of his face, looking into the dim secret chamber which he had
      spoken of, and which, by something in his mode of alluding to it, assumed
      such a weird, spectral aspect to their imaginations that they never wished
      to hear of it again. Coming back at length out of his reverie,&mdash;returning,
      perhaps, out of some weird, ghostly, secret chamber of his memory, whereof
      the one in the old house was but the less horrible emblem,&mdash;he
      resumed his tale. He said that, a long time ago, a war broke out in the
      old country between King and Parliament. At that period there were several
      brothers of the old family (which had adhered to the Catholic religion),
      and these chose the side of the King instead of that of the Puritan
      Parliament: all but one, whom the family hated because he took the
      Parliament side; and he became a soldier, and fought against his own
      brothers; and it was said among them that, so inveterate was he, he went
      on the scaffold, masked, and was the very man who struck off the King&rsquo;s
      head, and that his foot trod in the King&rsquo;s blood, and that always
      afterwards he made a bloody track wherever he went. And there was a legend
      that his brethren once caught the renegade and imprisoned him in his own
      birthplace&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the secret chamber?&rdquo; interrupted Ned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt!&rdquo; said the Doctor, nodding, &ldquo;though I never heard so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They imprisoned him, but he made his escape and fled, and in the morning
      his prison-place, wherever it was, was empty. But on the threshold of the
      door of the old manor-house there was the print of a bloody footstep; and
      no trouble that the housemaids took, no rain of all the years that have
      since passed, no sunshine, has made it fade: nor have all the wear and
      tramp of feet passing over it since then availed to erase it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen it myself,&rdquo; quoth the Doctor, &ldquo;and know this to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Grim, now you are laughing at us,&rdquo; said Ned, trying to look grave.
      But Elsie hid her face on the Doctor&rsquo;s knee; there being something that
      affected the vivid little girl with peculiar horror in the idea of this
      red footstep always glistening on the doorstep, and wetting, as she
      fancied, every innocent foot of child or grown person that had since
      passed over it. [Endnote: 3.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; reiterated the grim Doctor; &ldquo;for, man and boy, I have seen
      it a thousand times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued the family history, or tradition, or fantastic legend,
      whichever it might be; telling his young auditors that the Puritan, the
      renegade son of the family, was afterwards, by the contrivances of his
      brethren, sent to Virginia and sold as a bond slave; and how he had
      vanished from that quarter and come to New England, where he was supposed
      to have left children. And by and by two elder brothers died, and this
      missing brother became the heir to the old estate and to a title. Then the
      family tried to track his bloody footstep, and sought it far and near,
      through green country paths, and old streets of London; but in vain. Then
      they sent messengers to see whether any traces of one stepping in blood
      could be found on the forest leaves of America; but still in vain. The
      idea nevertheless prevailed that he would come back, and it was said they
      kept a bedchamber ready for him yet in the old house. But much as they
      pretended to regret the loss of him and his children, it would make them
      curse their stars were a descendant of his to return now. For the child of
      a younger son was in possession of the old estate, and was doing as much
      evil as his forefathers did; and if the true heir were to appear on the
      threshold, he would (if he might but do it secretly) stain the whole
      doorstep as red as the Bloody Footstep had stained one little portion of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he will ever come back?&rdquo; asked little Ned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger things have happened, my little man!&rdquo; said Doctor Grimshawe,
      &ldquo;than that the posterity of this man should come back and turn these
      usurpers out of his rightful inheritance. And sometimes, as I sit here
      smoking my pipe and drinking my glass, and looking up at the cunning plot
      that the spider is weaving yonder above my head, and thinking of this fine
      old family and some little matters that have been between them and me, I
      fancy that it may be so! We shall see! Stranger things have happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Doctor Grimshawe drank off his tumbler, winking at little Ned in a
      strange way, that seemed to be a kind of playfulness, but which did not
      affect the children pleasantly; insomuch that little Elsie put both her
      hands on Doctor Grim&rsquo;s knees, and begged him not to do so any more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Endnote: 1]
    </p>
    <p>
      The children, after this conversation, often introduced the old English
      mansion into their dreams and little romances, which all imaginative
      children are continually mixing up with their lives, making the
      commonplace day of grown people a rich, misty, glancing orb of fairy-land
      to themselves. Ned, forgetting or not realizing the long lapse of time,
      used to fancy the true heir wandering all this while in America, and
      leaving a long track of bloody footsteps behind him; until the period
      when, his sins being expiated (whatever they might be), he should turn
      back upon his steps and return to his old native home. And sometimes the
      child used to look along the streets of the town where he dwelt, bending
      his thoughtful eyes on the ground, and think that perhaps some time he
      should see the bloody footsteps there, betraying that the wanderer had
      just gone that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for little Elsie, it was her fancy that the hero of the legend still
      remained imprisoned in that dreadful secret chamber, which had made a most
      dread impression on her mind; and that there he was, forgotten all this
      time, waiting, like a naughty child shut up in a closet, until some one
      should come to unlock the door. In the pitifulness of her disposition, she
      once proposed to little Ned that, as soon as they grew big enough, they
      should set out in quest of the old house, and find their way into it, and
      find the secret chamber, and let the poor prisoner out. So they lived a
      good deal of the time in a half-waking dream, partly conscious of the
      fantastic nature of their ideas, yet with these ideas almost as real to
      them as the facts of the natural world, which, to children, are at first
      transparent and unsubstantial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor appeared to have a pleasure, or a purpose, in keeping his
      legend forcibly in their memories; he often recurred to the subject of the
      old English family, and was continually giving new details about its
      history, the scenery in its neighborhood, the aspect of the mansion-house;
      indicating a very intense interest in the subject on his own part, of
      which this much talk seemed the involuntary overflowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, an affection mingled with this sentiment. It appeared
      to be his unfortunate necessity to let his thoughts dwell very constantly
      upon a subject that was hateful to him, with which this old English estate
      and manor-house and family were somehow connected; and, moreover, had he
      spoken thus to older and more experienced auditors, they might have
      detected in the manner and matter of his talk, a certain hereditary
      reverence and awe, the growth of ages, mixed up with a newer hatred,
      impelling him to deface and destroy what, at the same time, it was his
      deepest impulse to bow before. The love belonged to his race; the hatred,
      to himself individually. It was the feeling of a man lowly born, when he
      contracts a hostility to his hereditary superior. In one way, being of a
      powerful, passionate nature, gifted with force and ability far superior to
      that of the aristocrat, he might scorn him and feel able to trample on
      him; in another, he had the same awe that a country boy feels of the
      magistrate who flings him a sixpence and shakes his horsewhip at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the grim Doctor been an American, he might have had the vast antipathy
      to rank, without the trace of awe that made it so much more malignant: it
      required a low-born Englishman to feel the two together. What made the
      hatred so fiendish was a something that, in the natural course of things,
      would have been loyalty, inherited affection, devoted self-sacrifice to a
      superior. Whatever it might be, it seemed at times (when his potations
      took deeper effect than ordinary) almost to drive the grim Doctor mad; for
      he would burst forth in wild diatribes and anathemas, having a strange,
      rough force of expression and a depth of utterance, as if his words came
      from a bottomless pit within himself, where burned an everlasting fire,
      and where the furies had their home; and plans of dire revenge were welded
      into shape as in the heat of a furnace. After the two poor children had
      been affrighted by paroxysms of this kind, the strange being would break
      out into one of his roars of laughter, that seemed to shake the house,
      and, at all events, caused the cobwebs and spiders suspended from the
      ceiling, to swing and vibrate with the motion of the volumes of
      reverberating breath which he thus expelled from his capacious lungs.
      Then, catching up little Elsie upon one knee and Ned upon the other, he
      would become gentler than in his usual moods, and, by the powerful
      magnetism of his character, cause them to think him as tender and sweet an
      old fellow as a child could desire for a playmate. Upon the whole, strange
      as it may appear, they loved the grim Doctor dearly; there was a loadstone
      within him that drew them close to him and kept them there, in spite of
      the horror of many things that he said and did. One thing that, slight as
      it seemed, wrought mightily towards their mutually petting each other, was
      that no amount of racket, hubbub, shouting, laughter, or noisy mischief
      which the two children could perpetrate, ever disturbed the Doctor&rsquo;s
      studies, meditations, or employments of whatever kind. He had a hardy set
      of nerves, not refined by careful treatment in himself or his ancestors,
      but probably accustomed from of old to be drummed on by harsh voices, rude
      sounds, and the clatter and clamor of household life among homely,
      uncultivated, strongly animal people.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two children grew apace, it behooved their strange guardian to take
      some thought for their instruction. So far as little Elsie was concerned,
      however, he seemed utterly indifferent to her having any cultivation:
      having imbibed no modern ideas respecting feminine capacities and
      privileges, but regarding woman, whether in the bud or in the blossom, as
      the plaything of man&rsquo;s idler moments, and the helpmeet&mdash;but in a
      humble capacity&mdash;of his daily life. He sometimes bade her go to the
      kitchen and take lessons of crusty Hannah in bread-making, sweeping,
      dusting, washing, the coarser needlework, and such other things as she
      would require to know when she came to be a woman; but carelessly allowed
      her to gather up the crumbs of such instruction as he bestowed on her
      playmate Ned, and thus learn to read, write, and cipher; which, to say the
      truth, was about as far in the way of scholarship as little Elsie cared to
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      But towards little Ned the grim Doctor adopted a far different system. No
      sooner had he reached the age when the soft and tender intellect of the
      child became capable of retaining impressions, than he took him vigorously
      in hand, assigning him such tasks as were fit for him, and curiously
      investigating what were the force and character of the powers with which
      the child grasped them. Not that the Doctor pressed him forward unduly;
      indeed, there was no need of it; for the boy manifested a remarkable
      docility for instruction, and a singular quickness in mastering the
      preliminary steps which lead to science: a subtle instinct, indeed, which
      it seemed wonderful a child should possess for anything as artificial as
      systems of grammar and arithmetic. A remarkable boy, in truth, he was, to
      have been found by chance in an almshouse; except that, such being his
      origin, we are at liberty to suppose for him whatever long cultivation and
      gentility we may think necessary, in his parentage of either side,&mdash;such
      as was indicated also by his graceful and refined beauty of person. He
      showed, indeed, even before he began to read at all, an instinctive
      attraction towards books, and a love for and interest in even the material
      form of knowledge,&mdash;the plates, the print, the binding of the
      Doctor&rsquo;s volumes, and even in a bookworm which he once found in an old
      volume, where it had eaten a circular furrow. But the little boy had too
      quick a spirit of life to be in danger of becoming a bookworm himself. He
      had this side of the intellect, but his impulse would be to mix with men,
      and catch something from their intercourse fresher than books could give
      him; though these would give him what they might.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the grim Doctor, rough and uncultivated as he seemed, this budding
      intelligence found no inadequate instructor. Doctor Grimshawe proved
      himself a far more thorough scholar, in the classics and mathematics, than
      could easily have been found in our country. He himself must have had
      rigid and faithful instruction at an early period of life, though probably
      not in his boyhood. For, though the culture had been bestowed, his mind
      had been left in so singularly rough a state that it seemed as if the
      refinement of classical study could not have been begun very early. Or
      possibly the mind and nature were incapable of polish; or he may have had
      a coarse and sordid domestic life around him in his infancy and youth. He
      was a gem of coarse texture, just hewn out. An American with a like
      education would more likely have gained a certain fineness and grace, and
      it would have been difficult to distinguish him from one who had been born
      to culture and refinement. This sturdy Englishman, after all that had been
      done for his mind, and though it had been well done, was still but another
      ploughman, of a long race of such, with a few scratchings of refinement on
      his hard exterior. His son, if he left one, might be a little less of the
      ploughman; his grandson, provided the female element were well chosen,
      might approach to refinement; three generations&mdash;a century at least&mdash;would
      be required for the slow toil of hewing, chiselling, and polishing a
      gentleman out of this ponderous block, now rough from the quarry of human
      nature. But, in the mean time, he evidently possessed in an unusual degree
      the sort of learning that refines other minds,&mdash;the critical
      acquaintance with the great poets and historians of antiquity, and
      apparently an appreciation of their merits, and power to teach their
      beauty. So the boy had an able tutor, capable, it would seem, of showing
      him the way to the graces he did not himself possess; besides helping the
      growth of the strength without which refinement is but sickly and
      disgusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sort of culture, which it seemed odd that this rude man should
      undertake, was that of manners; but, in fact, rude as the grim Doctor&rsquo;s
      own manners were, he was one of the nicest and severest censors in that
      department that was ever known. It is difficult to account for this;
      although it is almost invariably found that persons in a low rank of life,
      such as servants and laborers, will detect the false pretender to the
      character of a gentleman, with at least as sure an instinct as the class
      into which they seek to thrust themselves. Perhaps they recognize
      something akin to their own vulgarity, rather than appreciate what is
      unlike themselves. The Doctor possessed a peculiar power of rich rough
      humor on this subject, and used to deliver lectures, as it were, to little
      Ned, illustrated with sketches of living individuals in the town where
      they dwelt; by an unscrupulous use of whom he sought to teach the boy what
      to avoid in manners, if he sought to be a gentleman. But it must be
      confessed he spared himself as little as other people, and often wound up
      with this compendious injunction,&mdash;&ldquo;Be everything in your behavior
      that Doctor Grim is not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His pupil, very probably, profited somewhat by these instructions; for
      there are specialties and arbitrary rules of behavior which do not come by
      nature. But these are few; and beautiful, noble, and genial manners may
      almost be called a natural gift; and these, however he inherited them,
      soon proved to be an inherent possession of little Ned. He had a kind of
      natural refinement, which nothing could ever soil or offend; it seemed, by
      some magic or other, absolutely to keep him from the knowledge of much of
      the grim Doctor&rsquo;s rude and sordid exterior, and to render what was around
      him beautiful by a sort of affiliation, or reflection from that quality in
      himself, glancing its white light upon it. The Doctor himself was puzzled,
      and apparently both startled and delighted at the perception of these
      characteristics. Sometimes he would make a low, uncouth bow, after his
      fashion, to the little fellow, saying, &ldquo;Allow me to kiss your hand, my
      lord!&rdquo; and little Ned, not quite knowing what the grim Doctor meant, yet
      allowed the favor he asked, with a grave and gracious condescension that
      seemed much to delight the suitor. This refusal to recognize or to suspect
      that the Doctor might be laughing at him was a sure token, at any rate, of
      the lack of one vulgar characteristic in little Ned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to afford little Ned every advantage to these natural gifts,
      Doctor Grim nevertheless failed not to provide the best attainable
      instructor for such positive points of a polite education as his own
      fierce criticism, being destructive rather than generative, would not
      suffice for. There was a Frenchman in the town&mdash;a M. Le Grand,
      secretly calling himself a Count&mdash;who taught the little people, and,
      indeed, some of their elders, the Parisian pronunciation of his own
      language; and likewise dancing (in which he was more of an adept and more
      successful than in the former branch) and fencing: in which, after looking
      at a lesson or two, the grim Doctor was satisfied of his skill. Under his
      instruction, with the stimulus of the Doctor&rsquo;s praise and criticism, Ned
      soon grew to be the pride of the Frenchman&rsquo;s school, in both the active
      departments; and the Doctor himself added a further gymnastic acquirement
      (not absolutely necessary, he said, to a gentleman&rsquo;s education, but very
      desirable to a man perfect at all points) by teaching him cudgel-playing
      and pugilism. In short, in everything that related to accomplishments,
      whether of mind or body, no pains were spared with little Ned; but of the
      utilitarian line of education, then almost exclusively adopted, and
      especially desirable for a fortuneless boy like Ned, dependent on a man
      not wealthy, there was little given.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, too, the Doctor paid little attention to the moral and religious
      culture of his pupil; nor did he ever make a system of it. But by and by,
      though with a singular reluctance and kind of bashfulness, he began to
      extend his care to these matters; being drawn into them unawares, and
      possibly perceiving and learning what he taught as he went along. One
      evening, I know not how, he was betrayed into speaking on this point, and
      a sort of inspiration seized him. A vista opened before him: handling an
      immortal spirit, he began to know its requisitions, in a degree far beyond
      what he had conceived them to be when his great task was undertaken. His
      voice grew deep, and had a strange, impressive pathos in it; his talk
      became eloquent with depth of meaning and feeling, as he told the boy of
      the moral dangers of the world, for which he was seeking to educate him;
      and which, he said, presented what looked like great triumphs, and yet
      were the greatest and saddest of defeats. He told him that many things
      that seemed nearest and dearest to the heart of man were destructive,
      eating and gnawing away and corroding what was best in him; and what a
      high, noble, re-creating triumph it was when these dark impulses were
      resisted and overthrown; and how, from that epoch, the soul took a new
      start. He denounced the selfish greed of gold, lawless passion, revenge,&mdash;and
      here the grim Doctor broke out into a strange passion and zeal of anathema
      against this deadly sin, making a dreadful picture of the ruin that it
      creates in the heart where it establishes itself, and how it makes a
      corrosive acid of those genial juices. Then he told the boy that the
      condition of all good was, in the first place, truth; then, courage; then,
      justice; then, mercy; out of which principles operating upon one another
      would come all brave, noble, high, unselfish actions, and the scorn of all
      mean ones; and how that from such a nature all hatred would fall away, and
      all good affections would be ennobled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not at what point it was, precisely, in these ethical instructions
      that an insight seemed to strike the grim Doctor that something more&mdash;vastly
      more&mdash;was needed than all he had said; and he began, doubtfully, to
      speak of man&rsquo;s spiritual nature and its demands, and the emptiness of
      everything which a sense of these demands did not pervade, and condense,
      and weighten into realities. And going on in this strain, he soared out of
      himself and astonished the two children, who stood gazing at him,
      wondering whether it were the Doctor who was speaking thus; until some
      interrupting circumstance seemed to bring him back to himself, and he
      burst into one of his great roars of laughter. The inspiration, the
      strange light whereby he had been transfigured, passed out of his face;
      and there was the uncouth, wild-bearded, rough, earthy, passionate man,
      whom they called Doctor Grim, looking ashamed of himself, and trying to
      turn the whole matter into a jest. [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad pity that he should have been interrupted, and brought into
      this mocking mood, just when he seemed to have broken away from the
      sinfulness of his hot, evil nature, and to have soared into a region
      where, with all his native characteristics transfigured, he seemed to have
      become an angel in his own likeness. Crusty Hannah, who had been drawn to
      the door of the study by the unusual tones of his voice,&mdash;a kind of
      piercing sweetness in it,&mdash;always averred that she saw the gigantic
      spider swooping round his head in great crafty circles, and clutching, as
      it were, at his brain with its great claws. But it was the old woman&rsquo;s
      absurd idea that this hideous insect was the Devil, in that ugly guise,&mdash;a
      superstition which deserves absolutely no countenance. Nevertheless,
      though this paroxysm of devotional feeling and insight returned no more to
      the grim Doctor, it was ever after a memorable occasion to the two
      children. It touched that religious chord, in both their hearts, which
      there was no mother to touch; but now it vibrated long, and never ceased
      to vibrate so long as they remained together,&mdash;nor, perhaps, after
      they were parted from each other and from the grim Doctor. And even then,
      in those after years, the strange music that had been awakened was
      continued, as it were the echo from harps on high. Now, at all events,
      they made little prayers for themselves, and said them at bedtime,
      generally in secret, sometimes in unison; and they read in an old dusty
      Bible which lay among the grim Doctor&rsquo;s books; and from little heathens,
      they became Christian children. Doctor Grimshawe was perhaps conscious of
      this result of his involuntary preachment, but he never directly noticed
      it, and did nothing either to efface or deepen the impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was singular, however, that, in both the children&rsquo;s minds, this one
      gush of irresistible religious sentiment, breaking out of the grim
      Doctor&rsquo;s inner depths, like a sort of holy lava from a volcano that
      usually emitted quite other matter, (such as hot, melted wrath and hate,)
      quite threw out of sight, then and always afterwards, his darker
      characteristics. They remembered him, with faith and love, as a religious
      man, and forgot&mdash;what perhaps had made no impression on their
      innocent hearts&mdash;all the traits that other people might have called
      devilish. To them the grim Doctor was a saint, even during his lifetime
      and constant intercourse with them, and canonized forever afterwards.
      There is almost always, to be sure, this profound faith, with regard to
      those they love, in childhood; but perhaps, in this instance, the children
      really had a depth of insight that grown people lacked; a profound
      recognition of the bottom of this strange man&rsquo;s nature, which was of such
      stuff as martyrs and heroic saints might have been made of, though here it
      had been wrought miserably amiss. At any rate, his face with the holy awe
      upon it was what they saw and remembered, when they thought of their
      friend Doctor Grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      One effect of his zealous and analytic instruction of the boy was very
      perceptible. Heretofore, though enduring him, and occasionally making a
      plaything of him, it may be doubted whether the grim Doctor had really any
      strong affection for the child: it rather seemed as if his strong will
      were forcing him to undertake, and carry sedulously forward, a
      self-imposed task. All that he had done&mdash;his redeeming the bright
      child from poverty and nameless degradation, ignorance, and a sordid life
      hopeless of better fortune, and opening to him the whole realm of mighty
      possibilities in an American life&mdash;did not imply any love for the
      little individual whom he thus benefited. It had some other motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, approaching the child in this close, intimate, and helpful way,
      it was very evident that his interest took a tenderer character. There was
      everything in the boy, that a boy could possess, to attract affection; he
      would have been a father&rsquo;s pride and joy. Doctor Grimshawe, indeed, was
      not his father; but to a person of his character this was perhaps no cause
      of lesser love than if there had been the whole of that holy claim of
      kindred between them. We speak of the natural force of blood; we speak of
      the paternal relation as if it were productive of more earnest affection
      than can exist between two persons, one of whom is protective, but
      unrelated. But there are wild, forcible, unrestricted characters, on whom
      the necessity and even duty of loving their own child is a sort of barrier
      to love. They perhaps do not love their own traits, which they recognize
      in their children; they shrink from their own features in the reflection
      presented by these little mirrors. A certain strangeness and unlikeness
      (such as gives poignancy to the love between the sexes) would excite a
      livelier affection. Be this as it may, it is not probable that Doctor
      Grimshawe would have loved a child of his own blood, with the coarse
      characteristics that he knew both in his race and himself, with nearly
      such fervor as this beautiful, slender, yet strenuous, intelligent,
      refined boy,&mdash;with such a high-bred air, handling common things with
      so refined a touch, yet grasping them so firmly; throwing a natural grace
      on all he did. Was he not his father,&mdash;he that took this fair blossom
      out of the sordid mud in which he must soon have withered and perished?
      Was not this beautiful strangeness, which he so wondered at, the result of
      his care?
    </p>
    <p>
      And little Elsie? did the grim Doctor love her as well? Perhaps not, for,
      in the first place, there was a natural tie, though not the nearest,
      between her and Doctor Grimshawe, which made him feel that she was cast
      upon his love: a burden which he acknowledged himself bound to undertake.
      Then, too, there were unutterably painful reminiscences and thoughts, that
      made him gasp for breath, that turned his blood sour, that tormented his
      dreams with nightmares and hellish phantoms; all of which were connected
      with this innocent and happy child; so that, cheerful and pleasant as she
      was, there was to the grim Doctor a little fiend playing about his floor
      and throwing a lurid light on the wall, as the shadow of this
      sun-flickering child. It is certain that there was always a pain and
      horror mixed with his feelings towards Elsie; he had to forget himself, as
      it were, and all that was connected with the causes why she came to be,
      before he could love her. Amid his fondness, when he was caressing her
      upon his knee, pressing her to his rough bosom, as he never took the
      freedom to press Ned, came these hateful reminiscences, compelling him to
      set her down, and corrugating his heavy brows as with a pang of fiercely
      resented, strongly borne pain. Still, the child had no doubt contrived to
      make her way into the great gloomy cavern of the grim Doctor&rsquo;s heart, and
      stole constantly further and further in, carrying a ray of sunshine in her
      hand as a taper to light her way, and illuminate the rude dark pit into
      which she so fearlessly went.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doctor Grim [Endnote: 1] had the English faith in open air and daily
      acquaintance with the weather, whatever it might be; and it was his habit,
      not only to send the two children to play, for lack of a better place, in
      the graveyard, but to take them himself on long rambles, of which the
      vicinity of the town afforded a rich variety. It may be that the Doctor&rsquo;s
      excursions had the wider scope, because both he and the children were
      objects of curiosity in the town, and very much the subject of its gossip:
      so that always, in its streets and lanes, the people turned to gaze, and
      came to their windows and to the doors of shops to see this grim, bearded
      figure, leading along the beautiful children each by a hand, with a surly
      aspect like a bulldog. Their remarks were possibly not intended to reach
      the ears of the party, but certainly were not so cautiously whispered but
      they occasionally did do so. The male remarks, indeed, generally died away
      in the throats that uttered them; a circumstance that doubtless saved the
      utterer from some very rough rejoinder at the hands of the Doctor, who had
      grown up in the habit of a very ready and free recourse to his fists,
      which had a way of doubling themselves up seemingly of their own accord.
      But the shrill feminine voices sometimes sent their observations from
      window to window without dread of any such repartee on the part of the
      subject of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes, the old Spider-witch!&rdquo; quoth one shrill woman, &ldquo;with those
      two poor babes that he has caught in his cobweb, and is going to feed
      upon, poor little tender things! The bloody Englishman makes free with the
      dead bodies of our friends and the living ones of our children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How red his nose is!&rdquo; quoth another; &ldquo;he has pulled at the brandy-bottle
      pretty stoutly to-day, early as it is! Pretty habits those children will
      learn, between the Devil in the shape of a great spider, and this devilish
      fellow in his own shape! It were well that our townsmen tarred and
      feathered the old British wizard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as he got further off, two or three little blackguard barefoot boys
      shouted shrilly after him,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;Doctor Grim, Doctor Grim,
                       The Devil wove a web for him!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      being a nonsensical couplet that had been made for the grim Doctor&rsquo;s
      benefit, and was hooted in the streets, and under his own windows. Hearing
      such remarks and insults, the Doctor would glare round at them with red
      eyes, especially if the brandy-bottle had happened to be much in request
      that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, poor Doctor Grim had met with a fortune which befalls many a man
      with less cause than drew the public attention on this odd humorist; for,
      dwelling in a town which was as yet but a larger village, where everybody
      knew everybody, and claimed the privilege to know and discuss their
      characters, and where there were few topics of public interest to take off
      their attention, a very considerable portion of town talk and criticism
      fell upon him. The old town had a certain provincialism, which is less the
      characteristic of towns in these days, when society circulates so freely,
      than then: besides, it was a very rude epoch, just when the country had
      come through the war of the Revolution, and while the surges of that
      commotion were still seething and swelling, and while the habits and
      morals of every individual in the community still felt its influence; and
      especially the contest was too recent for an Englishman to be in very good
      odor, unless he should cease to be English, and become more American than
      the Americans themselves in repudiating British prejudices or principles,
      habits, mode of thought, and everything that distinguishes Britons at home
      or abroad. As Doctor Grim did not see fit to do this, and as, moreover, he
      was a very doubtful, questionable, morose, unamiable old fellow, not
      seeking to make himself liked nor deserving to be so, he was a very
      unpopular person in the town where he had chosen to reside. Nobody thought
      very well of him; the respectable people had heard of his pipe and
      brandy-bottle; the religious community knew that he never showed himself
      at church or meeting; so that he had not that very desirable strength (in
      a society split up into many sects) of being able to rely upon the party
      sympathies of any one of them. The mob hated him with the blind sentiment
      that makes one surly cur hostile to another surly cur. He was the most
      isolated individual to be found anywhere; and, being so unsupported,
      everybody was his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town, as it happened, had been pleased to interest itself much in this
      matter of Doctor Grim and the two children, insomuch as he never sent them
      to school, nor came with them to meeting of any kind, but was bringing
      them up ignorant heathen to all appearances, and, as many believed, was
      devoting them in some way to the great spider, to which he had bartered
      his own soul. It had been mooted among the selectmen, the fathers of the
      town, whether their duty did not require them to put the children under
      more suitable guardianship; a measure which, it may be, was chiefly
      hindered by the consideration that, in that case, the cost of supporting
      them would probably be transferred from the grim Doctor&rsquo;s shoulders to
      those of the community. Nevertheless, they did what they could. Maidenly
      ladies, prim and starched, in one or two instances called upon the Doctor&mdash;the
      two children meanwhile being in the graveyard at play&mdash;to give him
      Christian advice as to the management of his charge. But, to confess the
      truth, the Doctor&rsquo;s reception of these fair missionaries was not extremely
      courteous. They were, perhaps, partly instigated by a natural feminine
      desire to see the interior of a place about which they had heard much,
      with its spiders&rsquo; webs, its strange machines and confusing tools; so, much
      contrary to crusty Hannah&rsquo;s advice, they persisted in entering. Crusty
      Hannah listened at the door; and it was curious to see the delighted smile
      which came over her dry old visage as the Doctor&rsquo;s growling, rough voice,
      after an abrupt question or two, and a reply in a thin voice on the part
      of the maiden ladies, grew louder and louder, till the door opened, and
      forth came the benevolent pair in great discomposure. Crusty Hannah
      averred that their caps were much rumpled; but this view of the thing was
      questioned; though it were certain that the Doctor called after them
      downstairs, that, had they been younger and prettier, they would have
      fared worse. A male emissary, who was admitted on the supposition of his
      being a patient, did fare worse; for (the grim Doctor having been
      particularly intimate with the black bottle that afternoon) there was,
      about ten minutes after the visitor&rsquo;s entrance, a sudden fierce upraising
      of the Doctor&rsquo;s growl; then a struggle that shook the house; and, finally,
      a terrible rumbling down the stairs, which proved to be caused by the
      precipitate descent of the hapless visitor; who, if he needed no
      assistance of the grim Doctor on his entrance, certainly would have been
      the better for a plaster or two after his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the terms on which Doctor Grimshawe now stood with his adopted
      townspeople; and if we consider the dull little town to be full of
      exaggerated stories about the Doctor&rsquo;s oddities, many of them forged, all
      retailed in an unfriendly spirit; misconceptions of a character which, in
      its best and most candidly interpreted aspects, was sufficiently amenable
      to censure; surmises taken for certainties; superstitions&mdash;the
      genuine hereditary offspring of the frame of public mind which produced
      the witchcraft delusion&mdash;all fermenting together; and all this evil
      and uncharitableness taking the delusive hue of benevolent interest in two
      helpless children;&mdash;we may partly judge what was the odium in which
      the grim Doctor dwelt, and amid which he walked. The horrid suspicion,
      too, countenanced by his abode in the corner of the graveyard, affording
      the terrible Doctor such facilities for making free, like a ghoul as he
      was, with the relics of mortality from the earliest progenitor to the man
      killed yesterday by the Doctor&rsquo;s own drugs, was not likely to improve his
      reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heretofore contented himself with, at most, occasionally shaking
      his stick at his assailants; but this day the black bottle had imparted,
      it may be, a little more fire than ordinary to his blood; and besides, an
      unlucky urchin happened to take particularly good aim with a mud ball,
      which took effect right in the midst of the Doctor&rsquo;s bushy beard, and,
      being of a soft consistency, forthwith became incorporated with it. At
      this intolerable provocation the grim Doctor pursued the little villain,
      amid a shower of similar missiles from the boy&rsquo;s playmates, caught him as
      he was escaping into a back yard, dragged him into the middle of the
      street, and, with his stick, proceeded to give him his merited
      chastisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, hereupon, it was astonishing how sudden commotion flashed up like
      gunpowder along the street, which, except for the petty shrieks and
      laughter of a few children, was just before so quiet. Forth out of every
      window in those dusky, mean wooden houses were thrust heads of women old
      and young; forth out of every door and other avenue, and as if they
      started up from the middle of the street, or out of the unpaved sidewalks,
      rushed fierce avenging forms, threatening at full yell to take vengeance
      on the grim Doctor; who still, with that fierce dark face of his,&mdash;his
      muddy beard all flying abroad, dirty and foul, his hat fallen off, his red
      eyes flashing fire,&mdash;was belaboring the poor hinder end of the
      unhappy urchin, paying off upon that one part of the boy&rsquo;s frame the whole
      score which he had to settle with the rude boys of the town; giving him at
      once the whole whipping which he had deserved every day of his life, and
      not a stroke of which he had yet received. Need enough there was, no
      doubt, that somebody should interfere with such grim and immitigable
      justice; and certainly the interference was prompt, and promised to be
      effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with the old tyrant! Thrash him! Hang him! Tar and feather the
      viper&rsquo;s fry! the wizard! the body-snatcher!&rdquo; bellowed the mob, one member
      of which was raving with delirium tremens, and another was a madman just
      escaped from bedlam.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unaccountable where all this mischievous, bloodthirsty multitude
      came from,&mdash;how they were born into that quietness in such a moment
      of time! What had they been about heretofore? Were they waiting in
      readiness for this crisis, and keeping themselves free from other
      employment till it should come to pass? Had they been created for the
      moment, or were they fiends sent by Satan in the likeness of a blackguard
      population? There you might see the offscourings of the recently finished
      war,&mdash;old soldiers, rusty, wooden-legged: there, sailors, ripe for
      any kind of mischief; there, the drunken population of a neighboring
      grogshop, staggering helter-skelter to the scene, and tumbling over one
      another at the Doctor&rsquo;s feet. There came the father of the punished
      urchin, who had never shown heretofore any care for his street-bred
      progeny, but who now came pale with rage, armed with a pair of tongs; and
      with him the mother, flying like a fury, with her cap awry, and clutching
      a broomstick, as if she were a witch just alighted. Up they rushed from
      cellar doors, and dropped down from chamber windows; all rushing upon the
      Doctor, but overturning and thwarting themselves by their very multitude.
      For, as good Doctor Grim levelled the first that came within reach of his
      fist, two or three of the others tumbled over him and lay grovelling at
      his feet; the Doctor meanwhile having retreated into the angle between two
      houses. Little Ned, with a valor which did him the more credit inasmuch as
      it was exercised in spite of a good deal of childish trepidation, as his
      pale face indicated, brandished his fists by the Doctor&rsquo;s side; and little
      Elsie did what any woman may,&mdash;that is, screeched in Doctor Grim&rsquo;s
      behalf with full stretch of lungs. Meanwhile the street boys kept up a
      shower of mud balls, many of which hit the Doctor, while the rest were
      distributed upon his assailants, heightening their ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize the old scoundrel! the villain! the Tory! the dastardly Englishman!
      Hang him in the web of his own devilish spider,&mdash;&lsquo;t is long enough!
      Tar and feather him! tar and feather him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly one of those crises that show a man how few real friends
      he has, and the tendency of mankind to stand aside, at least, and let a
      poor devil fight his own troubles, if not assist them in their attack.
      Here you might have seen a brother physician of the grim Doctor&rsquo;s greatly
      tickled at his plight: or a decorous, powdered, ruffle-shirted dignitary,
      one of the weighty men of the town, standing at a neighbor&rsquo;s corner to see
      what would come of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not a respectable man, I understand, this Grimshawe,&mdash;a quack,
      intemperate, always in these scuffles: let him get out as he may!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then comes a deacon of one of the churches, and several
      church-members, who, hearing a noise, set out gravely and decorously to
      see what was going forward in a Christian community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is that irreligious and profane Grimshawe, who never goes to
      meeting. We wash our hands of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And one of the selectmen said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely this common brawler ought not to have the care of these nice,
      sweet children; something must be done about it; and when the man is
      sober, he must be talked to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it is a hard case with a man who lives upon his own bottom and
      responsibility, making himself no allies, sewing himself on to nobody&rsquo;s
      skirts, insulating himself,&mdash;hard, when his trouble comes; and so
      poor Doctor Grimshawe was like to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had succeeded by dint of good skill, and some previous practice at
      quarter-staff, in keeping his assailants at bay, though not without some
      danger on his own part; but their number, their fierceness, and the more
      skilled assault of some among them must almost immediately have been
      successful, when the Doctor&rsquo;s part was strengthened by an unexpected ally.
      This was a person [Endnote: 2] of tall, slight figure, who, without
      lifting his hands to take part in the conflict, thrust himself before the
      Doctor, and turned towards the assailants, crying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christian men, what would you do? Peace,&mdash;peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His so well intended exhortation took effect, indeed, in a certain way,
      but not precisely as might have been wished: for a blow, aimed at Doctor
      Grim, took effect on the head of this man, who seemed to have no sort of
      skill or alacrity at defending himself, any more than at making an
      assault; for he never lifted his hands, but took the blow as unresistingly
      as if it had been kindly meant, and it levelled him senseless on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the mob really been enraged for any strenuous cause, this incident
      would have operated merely as a preliminary whet to stimulate them to
      further bloodshed. But, as they were mostly actuated only by a natural
      desire for mischief, they were about as well satisfied with what had been
      done as if the Doctor himself were the victim. And besides, the fathers
      and respectabilities of the town, who had seen this mishap from afar, now
      began to put forward, crying out, &ldquo;Keep the peace! keep the peace! A riot!
      a riot!&rdquo; and other such cries as suited the emergency; and the crowd
      vanished more speedily than it had congregated, leaving the Doctor and the
      two children alone beside the fallen victim of a quarrel not his own. Not
      to dwell too long on this incident, the Doctor, laying hold of the last of
      his enemies, after the rest had taken to their heels, ordered him sternly
      to stay and help him bear the man, whom he had helped to murder, to his
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It concerns you, friend; for, if he dies, you hang to a dead certainty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was done accordingly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      About an hour thereafter there lay on a couch that had been hastily
      prepared in the study a person of singularly impressive presence: a thin,
      mild-looking man, with a peculiar look of delicacy and natural refinement
      about him, although he scarcely appeared to be technically and as to
      worldly position what we call a gentleman; plain in dress and simple in
      manner, not giving the idea of remarkable intellectual gifts, but with a
      kind of spiritual aspect, fair, clear complexion, gentle eyes, still
      somewhat clouded and obscured by the syncope into which a blow on the head
      had thrown him. He looked middle-aged, and yet there was a kind of
      childlike, simple expression, which, unless you looked at him with the
      very purpose of seeing the traces of time in his face, would make you
      suppose him much younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you find yourself now, my good fellow?&rdquo; asked Doctor
      Grimshawe, putting forth his hand to grasp that of the stranger, and
      giving it a good, warm shake. &ldquo;None the worse, I should hope?&rdquo; [Endnote:
      1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much the worse,&rdquo; answered the stranger: &ldquo;not at all, it may be. There
      is a pleasant dimness and uncertainty in my mode of being. I am taken off
      my feet, as it were, and float in air, with a faint delight in my
      sensations. The grossness, the roughness, the too great angularity of the
      actual, is removed from me. It is a state that I like well. It may be,
      this is the way that the dead feel when they awake in another state of
      being, with a dim pleasure, after passing through the brief darkness of
      death. It is very pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered dreamily, and sluggishly, reluctantly, as if there were a
      sense of repose in him which he disliked to break by putting any of his
      sensations into words. His voice had a remarkable sweetness and
      gentleness, though lacking in depth of melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take this,&rdquo; said the Doctor, who had been preparing some kind of
      potion in a teaspoon: it may have been a dose of his famous preparation of
      spider&rsquo;s web, for aught I know, the operation of which was said to be of a
      soothing influence, causing a delightful silkiness of sensation; but I
      know not whether it was considered good for concussions of the brain, such
      as it is to be supposed the present patient had undergone. &ldquo;Take this: it
      will do you good; and here I drink your very good health in something that
      will do me good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the grim Doctor quaffed off a tumbler of brandy and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sweet a contrast,&rdquo; murmured the stranger, &ldquo;between that scene of
      violence and this great peace that has come over me! It is as when one can
      say, I have fought the good fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the Doctor, with what would have been one of his
      deep laughs, but which he modified in consideration of his patient&rsquo;s
      tenderness of brain. &ldquo;We both of us fought a good fight; for though you
      struck no actual stroke, you took them as unflinchingly as ever I saw a
      man, and so turned the fortune of the battle better than if you smote with
      a sledge-hammer. Two things puzzle me in the affair. First, whence came my
      assailants, all in that moment of time, unless Satan let loose out of the
      infernal regions a synod of fiends, hoping thus to get a triumph over me.
      And secondly, whence came you, my preserver, unless you are an angel, and
      dropped down from the sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the stranger, with quiet simplicity. &ldquo;I was passing through
      the street to my little school, when I saw your peril, and felt it my duty
      to expostulate with the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the grim Doctor, &ldquo;come whence you will, you did an angel&rsquo;s
      office for me, and I shall do what an earthly man may to requite it.
      There, we will talk no more for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hushed up the children, who were already, of their own accord, walking
      on tiptoe and whispering, and he himself even went so far as to refrain
      from the usual incense of his pipe, having observed that the stranger, who
      seemed to be of a very delicate organization, had seemed sensible of the
      disagreeable effect on the atmosphere of the room. The restraint lasted,
      however, only till (in the course of the day) crusty Hannah had fitted up
      a little bedroom on the opposite side of the entry, to which she and the
      grim Doctor moved the stranger, who, though tall, they observed was of no
      great weight and substance,&mdash;the lightest man, the Doctor averred,
      for his size, that ever he had handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every possible care was taken of him, and in a day or two he was able to
      walk into the study again, where he sat gazing at the sordidness and
      unneatness of the apartment, the strange festoons and drapery of spiders&rsquo; 
      webs, the gigantic spider himself, and at the grim Doctor, so shaggy,
      grizzly, and uncouth, in the midst of these surroundings, with a
      perceptible sense of something very strange in it all. His mild, gentle
      regard dwelt too on the two beautiful children, evidently with a sense of
      quiet wonder how they should be here, and altogether a sense of their
      unfitness; they, meanwhile, stood a little apart, looking at him, somewhat
      disturbed and awed, as children usually are, by a sense that the stranger
      was not perfectly well, that he had been injured, and so set apart from
      the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come to me, little one?&rdquo; said he, holding out a delicate hand to
      Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie came to his side without any hesitation, though without any of the
      rush that accompanied her advent to those whom she affected. &ldquo;And you, my
      little man,&rdquo; added the stranger, quietly, and looking to Ned, who likewise
      willingly approached, and, shaking him by the offered hand, let it go
      again, but continued standing by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my little friends,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;that it is my
      business in life to instruct such little people as you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they obey you well, sir?&rdquo; asked Ned, perhaps conscious of a want of
      force in the person whom he addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled faintly. &ldquo;Not too well,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That has been my
      difficulty; for I have moral and religious objections, and also a great
      horror, to the use of the rod, and I have not been gifted with a harsh
      voice and a stern brow; so that, after a while, my little people sometimes
      get the better of me. The present generation of men is too gross for
      gentle treatment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; quoth Doctor Grimshawe, who had been observing this
      little scene, and trying to make out, from the mutual deportment of the
      stranger and the two children, what sort of man this fair, quiet stranger
      was, with his gentleness and weakness,&mdash;characteristics that were not
      attractive to himself, yet in which he acknowledged, as he saw them here,
      a certain charm; nor did he know, scarcely, whether to despise the one in
      whom he saw them, or to yield to a strange sense of reverence. So he
      watched the children, with an indistinct idea of being guided by them.
      &ldquo;You are quite right: the world now&mdash;and always before, as far as I
      ever heard&mdash;requires a great deal of brute force, a great deal of
      animal food and brandy in the man that is to make an impression on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convalescence of the stranger&mdash;he gave his name as Colcord&mdash;proceeded
      favorably; for the Doctor remarked that, delicate as his system was, it
      had a certain purity,&mdash;a simple healthfulness that did not run into
      disease as stronger constitutions might. It did not apparently require
      much to crush down such a being as this,&mdash;not much unkindly breath to
      blow out the taper of his life,&mdash;and yet, if not absolutely killed,
      there was a certain aptness to keep alive in him not readily to be
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was he in a condition so to do, than he went forth to look after
      the little school that he had spoken of, but soon came back, announcing in
      a very quiet and undisturbed way that, during his withdrawal from duty,
      the scholars had been distributed to other instructors, and consequently
      he was without place or occupation [Endnotes: 2, 3, 4.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hard case,&rdquo; said the Doctor, flinging a gruff curse at those who had so
      readily deserted the poor schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so hard,&rdquo; replied Colcord. &ldquo;These little fellows are an unruly set,
      born of parents who have led rough lives,&mdash;here in battle time, too,
      with the spirit of battle in them,&mdash;therefore rude and contentious
      beyond my power to cope with them. I have been taught, long ago,&rdquo; he
      added, with a peaceful smile, &ldquo;that my business in life does not lie with
      grown-up and consolidated men and women; and so, not to be useless in my
      day, and to gain the little that my sustenance requires, I have thought to
      deal with children. But even for this I lack force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said the Doctor, with a modified laugh. &ldquo;Little devils they
      are, harder to deal with than men. Well, I am glad of your failure for one
      reason, and of your being thrown out of business; because we shall have
      the benefit of you the longer. Here is this boy to be instructed. I have
      made some attempts myself; but having no art of instructing, no skill, no
      temper I suppose, I make but an indifferent hand at it: and besides I have
      other business that occupies my thoughts. Take him in hand, if you like,
      and the girl for company. No matter whether you teach her anything, unless
      you happen to be acquainted with needlework.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will talk with the children,&rdquo; said Colcord, &ldquo;and see if I am likely to
      do good with them. The lad, I see, has a singular spirit of aspiration and
      pride,&mdash;no ungentle pride,&mdash;but still hard to cope with. I will
      see. The little girl is a most comfortable child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read the boy as if you had his heart in your hand,&rdquo; said the
      Doctor, rather surprised. &ldquo;I could not have done it better myself, though
      I have known him all but from the egg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the stranger, who had been thrust so providentially into this
      odd and insulated little community, abode with them, without more words
      being spoken on the subject: for it seemed to all concerned a natural
      arrangement, although, on both parts, they were mutually sensible of
      something strange in the companionship thus brought about. To say the
      truth, it was not easy to imagine two persons apparently less adapted to
      each other&rsquo;s society than the rough, uncouth, animal Doctor, whose faith
      was in his own right arm, so full of the old Adam as he was, so sturdily a
      hater, so hotly impulsive, so deep, subtle, and crooked, so obstructed by
      his animal nature, so given to his pipe and black bottle, so wrathful and
      pugnacious and wicked,&mdash;and this mild spiritual creature, so milky,
      with so unforceful a grasp; and it was singular to see how they stood
      apart and eyed each other, each tacitly acknowledging a certain merit and
      kind of power, though not well able to appreciate its value. The grim
      Doctor&rsquo;s kindness, however, and gratitude, had been so thoroughly
      awakened, that he did not feel the disgust that he probably otherwise
      might at what seemed the mawkishness of Colcord&rsquo;s character; his want,
      morally speaking, of bone and muscle; his fastidiousness of character, the
      essence of which it seemed to be to bear no stain upon it; otherwise it
      must die.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Colcord&rsquo;s part there was a good deal of evidence to be detected, by a
      nice observer, that he found it difficult to put up with the Doctor&rsquo;s
      coarse peculiarities, whether physical or moral. His animal indulgences of
      appetite struck him with wonder and horror; his coarse expressions, his
      free indulgence of wrath, his sordid and unclean habits; the dust, the
      cobwebs, the monster that dangled from the ceiling; his pipe, diffusing
      its fragrance through the house, and showing, by the plainest and simplest
      proof, how we all breathe one another&rsquo;s breath, nice and proud as we may
      be, kings and daintiest ladies breathing the air that has already served
      to inflate a beggar&rsquo;s lungs. He shrank, too, from the rude manhood of the
      Doctor&rsquo;s character, with its human warmth,&mdash;an element which he
      seemed not to possess in his own character. He was capable only of gentle
      and mild regard,&mdash;that was his warmest affection; and the warmest,
      too, that he was capable of exciting in others. So that he was doomed as
      much apparently as the Doctor himself to be a lonely creature, without any
      very deep companionship in the world, though not incapable, when he, by
      some rare chance, met a soul distantly akin, of holding a certain high
      spiritual communion. With the children, however, he succeeded in
      establishing some good and available relations; his simple and passionless
      character coincided with their simplicity, and their as yet unawakened
      passions: they appeared to understand him better than the Doctor ever
      succeeded in doing. He touched springs and elements in the nature of both
      that had never been touched till now, and that sometimes made a sweet,
      high music. But this was rarely; and as far as the general duties of an
      instructor went, they did not seem to be very successfully performed.
      Something was cultivated; the spiritual germ grew, it might be; but the
      children, and especially Ned, were intuitively conscious of a certain want
      of substance in the instructor,&mdash;a something of earthly bulk; a too
      etherealness. But his connection with our story does not lie in any
      excellence, or lack of excellence, that he showed as an instructor, and we
      merely mention these things as illustrating more or less his
      characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grim Doctor&rsquo;s curiosity was somewhat piqued by what he could see of
      the schoolmaster&rsquo;s character, and he was desirous of finding out what sort
      of a life such a man could have led in a world which he himself had found
      so rough a one; through what difficulties he had reached middle age
      without absolutely vanishing away in his contact with more positive
      substances than himself; how the world had given him a subsistence, if
      indeed he recognized anything more dense than fragrance, like a certain
      people whom Pliny mentioned in Africa,&mdash;a point, in fact, which the
      grim Doctor denied, his performance at table being inappreciable, and
      confined, at least almost entirely, to a dish of boiled rice, which crusty
      Hannah set before him, preparing it, it might be, with a sympathy of her
      East Indian part towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Doctor Grimshawe easily got at what seemed to be all of the facts of
      Colcord&rsquo;s life; how that he was a New-Englander, the descendant of an
      ancient race of settlers, the last of them; for, once pretty numerous in
      their quarter of the country, they seemed to have been dying out,&mdash;exhaling
      from the earth, and passing to some other region.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; said the Doctor bluffly. &ldquo;You have been letting slip the
      vital principle, if you are a fair specimen of the race. You do not clothe
      yourself in substance. Your souls are not coated sufficiently. Beef and
      brandy would have saved you. You have exhaled for lack of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster shook his head, and probably thought his earthly
      salvation and sustenance not worth buying at such a cost. The remainder of
      his history was not tangible enough to afford a narrative. There seemed,
      from what he said, to have always been a certain kind of refinement in his
      race, a nicety of conscience, a nicety of habit, which either was in
      itself a want of force, or was necessarily connected with it, and which,
      the Doctor silently thought, had culminated in the person before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was always in us,&rdquo; continued Colcord, with a certain pride which
      people generally feel in their ancestral characteristics, be they good or
      evil. &ldquo;We had a tradition among us of our first emigrant, and the causes
      that brought him to the New World; and it was said that he had suffered so
      much, before quitting his native shores, so painful had been his track,
      that always afterwards on the forest leaves of this land his foot left a
      print of blood wherever he trod.&rdquo; [Endnote: 5.]

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A print of blood!&rdquo; said the grim Doctor, breaking his pipe-stem by some
      sudden spasm in his gripe of it. &ldquo;Pooh! the devil take the pipe! A very
      strange story that! Pray how was it?&rdquo; [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, it is but a very dim legend,&rdquo; answered the schoolmaster: &ldquo;although
      there are old yellow papers and parchments, I remember, in my father&rsquo;s
      possession, that had some reference to this man, too, though there was
      nothing in them about the bloody footprints. But our family legend is,
      that this man was of a good race, in the time of Charles the First,
      originally Papists, but one of them&mdash;the second you, our legend says&mdash;was
      of a milder, sweeter cast than the rest, who were fierce and bloody men,
      of a hard, strong nature; but he partook most of his mother&rsquo;s character.
      This son had been one of the earliest Quakers, converted by George Fox;
      and moreover there had been love between him and a young lady of great
      beauty and an heiress, whom likewise the eldest son of the house had
      designed to make his wife. And these brothers, cruel men, caught their
      innocent brother and kept him in confinement long in his own native home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the Doctor. &ldquo;Why did not he appeal to the laws?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our legend says,&rdquo; replied the schoolmaster, &ldquo;only that he was kept in a
      chamber that was forgotten.&rdquo; [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very strange that!&rdquo; quoth the Doctor. &ldquo;He was sold by his brethren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster went on to tell, with much shuddering, how a Jesuit
      priest had been mixed up with this wretched business, and there had been a
      scheme at once religious and political to wrest the estate and the lovely
      lady from the fortunate heir; and how this grim Italian priest had
      instigated them to use a certain kind of torture with the poor heir, and
      how he had suffered from this; but one night, when they left him
      senseless, he contrived to make his escape from that cruel home, bleeding
      as he went; and how, by some action of his imagination,&mdash;his sense of
      the cruelty and hideousness of such treatment at his brethren&rsquo;s hands, and
      in the holy name of his religion,&mdash;his foot, which had been crushed
      by their cruelty, bled as he went, and that blood had never been stanched.
      And thus he had come to America, and after many wanderings, and much track
      of blood along rough ways, to New England. [Endnote: 3.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what became of his beloved?&rdquo; asked the grim Doctor, who was puffing
      away at a fresh pipe with a very queer aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She died in England,&rdquo; replied the schoolmaster. &ldquo;And before her death, by
      some means or other, they say that she found means to send him a child,
      the offspring of their marriage, and from that child our race descended.
      And they say, too, that she sent him a key to a coffin, in which was
      locked up a great treasure. But we have not the key. But he never went
      back to his own country; and being heart-broken, and sick and weary of the
      world and its pomps and vanities, he died here, after suffering much
      persecution likewise from the Puritans. For his peaceful religion was
      accepted nowhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all legends,&mdash;all foolish legends,&rdquo; quoth the Doctor, wrathfully,
      with a face of a dark blood-red color, so much was his anger and contempt
      excited, &ldquo;and of all absurd heroes of a legend, I never heard the like of
      this! Have you the key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nor have I ever heard of it,&rdquo; answered the schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have some papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They existed once: perhaps are still recoverable by search,&rdquo; said the
      schoolmaster. &ldquo;My father knew of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A foolish legend,&rdquo; reiterated the Doctor. &ldquo;It is strange how human folly
      strings itself on to human folly, as a story originally false and foolish
      grows older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and walked about the room, with hasty and irregular strides and
      a prodigious swinging of his ragged dressing-gown, which swept away as
      many cobwebs as it would take a week to reproduce. After a few turns, as
      if to change the subject, the Doctor asked the schoolmaster if he had any
      taste for pictures, and drew his attention to the portrait which has been
      already mentioned,&mdash;the figure in antique sordid garb, with a halter
      round his neck, and the expression in his face which the Doctor and the
      two children had interpreted so differently. Colcord, who probably knew
      nothing about pictures, looked at it at first merely from the gentle and
      cool complaisance of his character; but becoming absorbed in the
      contemplation, stood long without speaking; until the Doctor, looking in
      his face, perceived his eyes were streaming with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you crying about?&rdquo; said he, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster quietly. &ldquo;But there is something in
      this picture that affects me inexpressibly; so that, not being a man
      passionate by nature, I have hardly ever been so moved as now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very foolish,&rdquo; muttered the Doctor, resuming his strides about the room.
      &ldquo;I am ashamed of a grown man that can cry at a picture, and can&rsquo;t tell the
      reason why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few more turns he resumed his easy-chair and his tumbler, and,
      looking upward, beckoned to his pet spider, which came dangling downward,
      great parti-colored monster that he was, and swung about his master&rsquo;s head
      in hideous conference as it seemed; a sight that so distressed the
      schoolmaster, or shocked his delicate taste, that he went out, and called
      the two children to take a walk with him, with the purpose of breathing
      air that was neither infected with spiders nor graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his departure, Doctor Grimshawe seemed even more disturbed than
      during his presence: again he strode about the study; then sat down with
      his hands on his knees, looking straight into the fire, as if it imaged
      the seething element of his inner man, where burned hot projects, smoke,
      heat, blackness, ashes, a smouldering of old thoughts, a blazing up of
      new; casting in the gold of his mind, as Aaron did that of the Israelites,
      and waiting to see what sort of a thing would come out of the furnace. The
      children coming in from their play, he spoke harshly to them, and eyed
      little Ned with a sort of savageness, as if he meant to eat him up, or do
      some other dreadful deed: and when little Elsie came with her usual
      frankness to his knee, he repelled her in such a way that she shook her
      little hand at him, saying, &ldquo;Naughty Doctor Grim, what has come to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all that day, by some subtle means or other, the whole household
      knew that something was amiss; and nobody in it was comfortable. It was
      like a spell of weather; like the east wind; like an epidemic in the air,
      that would not let anything be comfortable or contented,&mdash;this
      pervading temper of the Doctor. Crusty Hannah knew it in the kitchen: even
      those who passed the house must have known it somehow or other, and have
      felt a chill, an irritation, an influence on the nerves, as they passed.
      The spiders knew it, and acted as they were wont to do in stormy weather.
      The schoolmaster, when he returned from his walk, seemed likewise to know
      it, and made himself secure and secret, keeping in his own room, except at
      dinner, when he ate his rice in silence, without looking towards the
      Doctor, and appeared before him no more till evening, when the grim Doctor
      summoned him into the study, after sending the two children to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; began the Doctor, &ldquo;you have spoken of some old documents in your
      possession relating to the English descent of your ancestors. I have a
      curiosity to see these documents. Where are they?&rdquo; [Endnote: 4.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have them about my person,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster; and he produced from
      his pocket a bundle of old yellow papers done up in a parchment cover,
      tied with a piece of white cord, and presented them to Doctor Grimshawe,
      who looked over them with interest. They seemed to consist of letters,
      genealogical lists, certified copies of entries in registers, things which
      must have been made out by somebody who knew more of business than this
      ethereal person in whose possession they now were. The Doctor looked at
      them with considerable attention, and at last did them hastily up in the
      bundle again, and returned them to the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea what is now the condition of the family to whom these
      papers refer?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever,&mdash;none for almost a hundred years,&rdquo; said the
      schoolmaster. &ldquo;About that time ago, I have heard a vague story that one of
      my ancestors went to the old country and saw the place. But, you see, the
      change of name has effectually covered us from view; and I feel that our
      true name is that which my ancestor assumed when he was driven forth from
      the home of his fathers, and that I have nothing to do with any other. I
      have no views on the estate,&mdash;none whatever. I am not so foolish and
      dreamy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Nothing is more foolish than to follow up
      such a pursuit as this, against all the vested interests of two hundred
      years, which of themselves have built up an impenetrably strong allegation
      against you. They harden into stone, in England, these years, and become
      indestructible, instead of melting away as they do in this happy country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a matter of interest with me,&rdquo; replied the schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right,&mdash;very right!&rdquo; repeated the grim Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something was evidently amiss with him this evening. It was impossible
      to feel easy and comfortable in contact with him: if you looked in his
      face, there was the red, lurid glare of his eyes; meeting you fiercely and
      craftily as ever: sometimes he bit his lip and frowned in an awful manner.
      Once, he burst out into an awful fit of swearing, for no good reason, or
      any reason whatever that he explained, or that anybody could tell. Again,
      for no more suitable reason, he uplifted his stalwart arm, and smote a
      heavy blow with his fist upon the oak table, making the tumbler and black
      bottle leap up, and damaging, one would think, his own knuckles. Then he
      rose up, and resumed his strides about the room. He paused before the
      portrait before mentioned; then resumed his heavy, quick, irregular tread,
      swearing under his breath; and you would imagine, from what you heard,
      that all his thoughts and the movement of his mind were a blasphemy. Then
      again&mdash;but this was only once&mdash;he heaved a deep, ponderous sigh,
      that seemed to come up in spite of him, out of his depths, an exhalation
      of deep suffering, as if some convulsion had given it a passage to upper
      air, instead of its being hidden, as it generally was, by accumulated
      rubbish of later time heaped above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter sound appealed to something within the simple schoolmaster,
      who had been witnessing the demeanor of the Doctor, like a being looking
      from another sphere into the trouble of the mortal one; a being incapable
      of passion, observing the mute, hard struggle of one in its grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;thou hast something on thy mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the grim Doctor, coming to a stand before his chair. &ldquo;You see
      that? Can you see as well what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some stir and writhe of something in the past that troubles you, as if
      you had kept a snake for many years in your bosom, and stupefied it with
      brandy, and now it awakes again, and troubles you with bites and stings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a man do you think me?&rdquo; asked the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster. &ldquo;The sympathies of my nature are
      not those that should give me knowledge of such men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, think you,&rdquo; continued the grim Doctor, &ldquo;a man capable of great
      crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great one, if any,&rdquo; said Colcord; &ldquo;a great good, likewise, it might
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would I be likely to do,&rdquo; asked Doctor Grim, &ldquo;supposing I had a
      darling purpose, to the accomplishment of which I had given my soul,&mdash;yes,
      my soul,&mdash;my success in life, my days and nights of thought, my years
      of time, dwelling upon it, pledging myself to it, until at last I had
      grown to love the burden of it, and not to regret my own degradation? I, a
      man of strongest will. What would I do, if this were to be resisted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not conceive of the force of will shaping out my ways,&rdquo; said the
      schoolmaster. &ldquo;I walk gently along and take the path that opens before
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; shouted the grim Doctor, with one of his portentous laughs.
      &ldquo;So do we all, in spite of ourselves; and sometimes the path comes to a
      sudden ending!&rdquo; And he resumed his drinking.

    <p>
      The schoolmaster looked at him with wonder, and a kind of shuddering, at
      something so unlike himself; but probably he very imperfectly estimated
      the forces that were at work within this strange being, and how dangerous
      they made him. He imputed it, a great deal, to the brandy, which he had
      kept drinking in such inordinate quantities; whereas it is probable that
      this had a soothing, emollient effect, as far as it went, on the Doctor&rsquo;s
      emotions; a sort of like to like, that he instinctively felt to be a
      remedy, But in truth it was difficult to see these two human creatures
      together, without feeling their incompatibility; without having a sense
      that one must be hostile to the other. The schoolmaster, through his fine
      instincts, doubtless had a sense of this, and sat gazing at the lurid,
      wrathful figure of the Doctor, in a sort of trance and fascination: not
      able to stir; bewildered by the sight of the great spider and other
      surroundings; and this strange, uncouth fiend, who had always been
      abhorrent to him,&mdash;he had a kind of curiosity in it, waited to see
      what would come of it, but felt it to be an unnatural state to him. And
      again the grim Doctor came and stood before him, prepared to make another
      of those strange utterances with which he had already so perplexed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night&mdash;that midnight&mdash;it was rumored through the town that
      one of the inhabitants, going home late along the street that led by the
      graveyard, saw the grim Doctor standing by the open window of the study
      behind the elm tree, in his old dressing-gown, chill as was the night, and
      flinging his arms abroad wildly into the darkness, and muttering like the
      growling of a tempest, with occasional vociferations that grew even shrill
      with passion. The listener, though affrighted, could not resist an impulse
      to pause, and attempt overhearing something that might let him into the
      secret counsels of this strange wild man, whom the town held in such awe
      and antipathy; to learn, perhaps, what was the great spider, and whether
      he were summoning the dead out of their graves. However, he could make
      nothing out of what he overheard, except it were fragmentary curses, of a
      dreadful character, which the Doctor brought up with might and main out of
      the depths of his soul, and flung them forth, burning hot, aimed at what,
      and why, and to what practical end, it was impossible to say; but as
      necessarily as a volcano, in a state of eruption, sends forth boiling
      lava, sparkling and scintillating stones, and a sulphurous atmosphere,
      indicative of its inward state. [Endnote: 5.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreading lest some one of these ponderous anathemas should alight, reason
      or none, on his own head, the man crept away, and whispered the thing to
      his cronies, from whom it was communicated to the townspeople at large,
      and so became one of many stories circulating with reference to our grim
      hero, which, if not true to the fact, had undoubtedly a degree of
      appositeness to his character, of which they were the legitimate flowers
      and symbols. If the anathemas took no other effect, they seemed to have
      produced a very remarkable one on the unfortunate elm tree, through the
      naked branches of which the Doctor discharged this fiendish shot. For, the
      next spring, when April came, no tender leaves budded forth, no life
      awakened there; and never again, on that old elm, widely as its roots were
      imbedded among the dead of many years, was there rustling bough in the
      summer time, or the elm&rsquo;s early golden boughs in September; and after
      waiting till another spring to give it a fair chance of reviving, it was
      cut down and made into coffins, and burnt on the sexton&rsquo;s hearth. The
      general opinion was that the grim Doctor&rsquo;s awful profanity had blasted
      that tree, fostered, as it had been, on grave-mould of Puritans. In
      Lancashire they tell of a similar anathema. It had a very frightful
      effect, it must be owned, this idea of a man cherishing emotions in his
      breast of so horrible a nature that he could neither tell them to any
      human being, nor keep them in their plenitude and intensity within the
      breast where they had their germ, and so was forced to fling them forth
      upon the night, to pollute and put fear into the atmosphere, and that
      people should breathe-in somewhat of horror from an unknown source, and be
      affected with nightmare, and dreams in which they were startled at their
      own wickedness.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the breakfast-table the next morning, however, appeared Doctor
      Grimshawe, wearing very much the same aspect of an uncombed, unshorn,
      unbrushed, odd sort of a pagan as at other times, and making no difference
      in his breakfast, except that he poured a pretty large dose of brandy into
      his cup of tea; a thing, however, by no means unexampled or very unusual
      in his history. There were also the two children, fresher than the morning
      itself, rosy creatures, with newly scrubbed cheeks, made over again for
      the new day, though the old one had left no dust upon them;[Endnote: 1]
      laughing with one another, flinging their little jokes about the table,
      and expecting that the Doctor might, as was often his wont, set some
      ponderous old English joke trundling round among the breakfast cups;
      eating the corn-cakes which crusty Hannah, with the aboriginal part of
      her, had a knack of making in a peculiar and exquisite fashion. But there
      was an empty chair at table; one cup, one little jug of milk, and another
      of pure water, with no guest to partake of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the schoolmaster?&rdquo; said Ned, pausing as he was going to take his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Doctor Grim?&rdquo; said little Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has overslept himself for once,&rdquo; quoth Doctor Grim gruffly; &ldquo;a strange
      thing, too, for a man whose victuals and drink are so light as the
      schoolmaster&rsquo;s. The fiend take me if I thought he had mortal mould enough
      in him ever to go to sleep at all; though he is but a kind of dream-stuff
      in his widest-awake state. Hannah, you bronze jade, call the schoolmaster
      to come to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannah departed on her errand, and was heard knocking at the door of the
      schoolmaster&rsquo;s chamber several times, till the Doctor shouted to her
      wrathfully to cease her clatter and open the door at once, which she
      appeared to do, and speedily came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He no there, massa. Schoolmaster melted away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanished like a bubble!&rdquo; quoth the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great spider caught him like a fly,&rdquo; quoth crusty Hannah, chuckling
      with a sense of mischief that seemed very pleasant to her strange
      combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken a morning walk,&rdquo; said little Ned; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think so,
      Doctor Grim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the grim Doctor. &ldquo;Go on with your breakfast, little monkey;
      the walk may be a long one, or he is so slight a weight that the wind may
      blow him overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very long walk it proved; or it might be that some wind, whether evil or
      good, had blown him, as the Doctor suggested, into parts unknown; for,
      from that time forth, the Yankee schoolmaster returned no more. It was a
      singular disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bed did not appear to have been slept in; there was a bundle, in a
      clean handkerchief, containing two shirts, two pocket handkerchiefs, two
      pairs of cotton socks, a Testament, and that was all. Had he intended to
      go away, why did he not take this little luggage in his hand, being all he
      had, and of a kind not easily dispensed with? The Doctor made small
      question about it, however; he had seemed surprised, at first, yet gave
      certainly no energetic token of it; and when Ned, who began to have
      notions of things, proposed to advertise him in the newspapers, or send
      the town crier round, the Doctor ridiculed the idea unmercifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost, a lank Yankee schoolmaster,&rdquo; quoth he, uplifting his voice after
      the manner of the town crier; &ldquo;supposed to have been blown out of Doctor
      Grim&rsquo;s window, or perhaps have ridden off astride of a humble-bee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not pretty to laugh in that way, Doctor Grim,&rdquo; said little Elsie,
      looking into his face, with a grave shake of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, you saucy little witch?&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the way to laugh, Doctor Grim,&rdquo; persisted the child, but either
      could not or would not assign any reason for her disapprobation, although
      what she said appeared to produce a noticeable effect on Doctor Grimshawe,
      who lapsed into a rough, harsh manner, that seemed to satisfy Elsie
      better. Crusty Hannah, meanwhile, seemed to dance about the house with a
      certain singular alacrity, a wonderful friskiness, indeed, as if the
      diabolical result of the mixture in her nature was particularly pleased
      with something; so she went, with queer gesticulations, crossings,
      contortions, friskings, evidently in a very mirthful state; until, being
      asked by her master what was the matter, she replied, &ldquo;Massa, me know what
      became of the schoolmaster. Great spider catch in his web and eat him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether that was the mode of his disappearance, or some other, certainly
      the schoolmaster was gone; and the children were left in great
      bewilderment at the sudden vacancy in his place. They had not contracted a
      very yearning affection for him, and yet his impression had been
      individual and real, and they felt that something was gone out of their
      lives, now that he was no longer there. Something strange in their
      circumstances made itself felt by them; they were more sensible of the
      grim Doctor&rsquo;s uncouthness, his strange, reprehensible habits, his dark,
      mysterious life,&mdash;in looking at these things, and the spiders, and
      the graveyard, and their insulation from the world, through the crystal
      medium of this stranger&rsquo;s character. In remembering him in connection with
      these things, a certain seemly beauty in him showed strikingly the
      unfitness, the sombre and tarnished color, the outréness, of the rest of
      their lot. Little Elsie perhaps felt the loss of him more than her
      playmate, although both had been interested by him. But now things
      returned pretty much to their old fashion; although, as is inevitably the
      case, whenever persons or things have been taken suddenly or unaccountably
      out of our sphere, without telling us whither and why they have
      disappeared, the children could not, for a long while, bring themselves to
      feel that he had really gone. Perhaps, in imitation of the custom in that
      old English house, of which the Doctor had told them, little Elsie
      insisted that his place should still be kept at the table; and so,
      whenever crusty Hannah neglected to do so, she herself would fetch a
      plate, and a little pitcher of water, and set it beside a vacant chair;
      and sometimes, so like a shadow had he been, this pale, slender creature,
      it almost might have been thought that he was sitting with them. But
      crusty Hannah shook her head, and grinned. &ldquo;The spider know where he is.
      We never see him more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His abode in the house had been of only two or three weeks; and in the
      natural course of things, had he come and gone in an ordinary way, his
      recollection would have grown dim and faded out in two or three weeks
      more; but the speculations, the expectations, the watchings for his
      reappearance, served to cut and grave the recollection of him into the
      children&rsquo;s hearts, so that it remained a life-long thing with them,&mdash;a
      sense that he was something that had been lost out of their life too soon,
      and that was bound, sooner or later, to reappear, and finish what business
      he had with them. Sometimes they prattled around the Doctor&rsquo;s chair about
      him, and they could perceive sometimes that he appeared to be listening,
      and would chime in with some remark; but he never expressed either wonder
      or regret; only telling Ned, once, that he had no reason to be sorry for
      his disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Doctor Grim?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor mused, and smoked his pipe, as if he himself were thinking why,
      and at last he answered, &ldquo;He was a dangerous fellow, my old boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Ned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have taken the beef out of you,&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not how long it was before any other visitor (except such as
      brought their shattered constitutions there in hopes that the Doctor would
      make the worn-out machinery as good as new) came to the lonely little
      household on the corner of the graveyard. The intercourse between
      themselves and the rest of the town remained as scanty as ever. Still, the
      grim, shaggy Doctor was seen setting doggedly forth, in all seasons and
      all weathers, at a certain hour of the day, with the two children, going
      for long walks on the sea-shore, or into the country, miles away, and
      coming back, hours afterwards, with plants and herbs that had perhaps
      virtue in them, or flowers that had certainly beauty; even, in their
      season, the fragrant magnolias, leaving a trail of fragrance after them,
      that grow only in spots, the seeds having been apparently dropped by some
      happy accident when those proper to the climate were distributed. Shells
      there were, also, in the baskets that they carried, minerals, rare things,
      that a magic touch seemed to have created out of the rude and common
      things that others find in a homely and ordinary region. The boy was
      growing tall, and had got out of the merely infantile age; agile he was,
      bright, but still with a remarkable thoughtfulness, or gravity, or I know
      not what to call it; but it was a shadow, no doubt, falling upon him from
      something sombre in his warp of life, which the impressibility of his age
      and nature so far acknowledged as to be a little pale and grave, without
      positive unhappiness; and when a playful moment came, as they often did to
      these two healthy children, it seemed all a mistake that you had ever
      thought either of them too grave for their age. But little Elsie was still
      the merrier. They were still children, although they quarrelled seldomer
      than of yore, and kissed seldomer, and had ceased altogether to complain
      of one another to the Doctor; perhaps the time when Nature saw these
      bickerings to be necessary to the growth of some of their faculties was
      nearly gone. When they did have a quarrel, the boy stood upon his dignity,
      and visited Elsie with a whole day, sometimes, of silent and stately
      displeasure, which she was accustomed to bear, sometimes with an
      assumption of cold indifference, sometimes with liveliness, mirth in
      double quantity, laughter almost as good as real,&mdash;little arts which
      showed themselves in her as naturally as the gift of tears and smiles. In
      fact, having no advantage of female intercourse, she could not well have
      learnt them unless from crusty Hannah, who was such an anomaly of a
      creature, with all her mixtures of race, that she struck you as having
      lost all sex as one result of it. Yet this little girl was truly feminine,
      and had all the manners and pre-eminently uncriticisable tenets proper to
      women at her early age.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made respectable advancement in study; that is, she had taught
      herself to write, with even greater mechanical facility than Ned; and
      other knowledge had fallen upon her, as it were, by a reflected light from
      him; or, to use another simile, had been spattered upon her by the full
      stream which the Doctor poured into the vessel of the boy&rsquo;s intellect. So
      that she had even some knowledge of the rudiments of Latin, and geometry,
      and algebra; inaccurate enough, but yet with such a briskness that she was
      sometimes able to assist Ned in studies in which he was far more deeply
      grounded than herself. All this, however, was more by sympathy than by any
      natural taste for such things; being kindly, and sympathetic, and
      impressible, she took the color of what was nearest to her, and especially
      when it came from a beloved object, so that it was difficult to discover
      that it was not really one of her native tastes. The only thing, perhaps,
      altogether suited to her idiosyncrasy (because it was truly feminine,
      calculated for dainty fingers, and a nice little subtlety) was that kind
      of embroidery, twisting, needle-work, on textile fabric, which, as we have
      before said, she learnt from crusty Hannah, and which was emblematic
      perhaps of that creature&rsquo;s strange mixture of races.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie seemed not only to have caught this art in its original spirit, but
      to have improved upon it, creating strange, fanciful, and graceful
      devices, which grew beneath her finger as naturally as the variegated hues
      grow in a flower as it opens; so that the homeliest material assumed a
      grace and strangeness as she wove it, whether it were grass, twigs,
      shells, or what not. Never was anything seen, that so combined a wild,
      barbarian freedom with cultivated grace; and the grim Doctor himself,
      little open to the impressions of the beautiful, used to hold some of her
      productions in his hand, gazing at them with deep intentness, and at last,
      perhaps, breaking out into one of his deep roars of laughter; for it
      seemed to suggest thoughts to him that the children could not penetrate.
      This one feature of strangeness and wild faculty in the otherwise sweet
      and natural and homely character of Elsie had a singular effect; it was
      like a wreath of wild-flowers in her hair, like something that set her a
      little way apart from the rest of the world, and had an even more striking
      effect than if she were altogether strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus were the little family going on; the Doctor, I regret to say, growing
      more morose, self-involved, and unattainable since the disappearance of
      the schoolmaster than before; more given up to his one plaything, the
      great spider; less frequently even than before coming out of the grim
      seclusion of his moodiness, to play with the children, though they would
      often be sensible of his fierce eyes fixed upon them, and start and feel
      incommoded by the intensity of his regard;&mdash;thus things were going
      on, when one day there was really again a visitor, and not a dilapidated
      patient, to the grim Doctor&rsquo;s study. Crusty Hannah brought up his name as
      Mr. Hammond, and the Doctor&mdash;filling his everlasting pipe, meanwhile,
      and ordering Hannah to give him a coal (perhaps this was the circumstance
      that made people say he had imps to bring him coals from Tophet)&mdash;ordered
      him to be shown up. [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh-colored, rather young man [Endnote: 3] entered the study, a person
      of rather cold and ungraceful manners, yet genial-looking enough; at
      least, not repulsive. He was dressed in rather a rough, serviceable
      travelling-dress, and except for a nicely brushed hat, and unmistakably
      white linen, was rather careless in attire. You would have thought twice,
      perhaps, before deciding him to be a gentleman, but finally would have
      decided that he was; one great token being, that the singular aspect of
      the room into which he was ushered, the spider festoonery, and other
      strange accompaniments, the grim aspect of the Doctor himself, and the
      beauty and intelligence of his two companions, and even that horrific
      weaver, the great dangling spider,&mdash;neither one nor all of these
      called any expression of surprise to the stranger&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Hammond?&rdquo; begins the Doctor, with his usual sparseness of
      ornamental courtesy. [Endnote: 4.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Englishman, I perceive,&rdquo; continued the Doctor, but nowise intimating
      that the fact of being a countryman was any recommendation in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an Englishman,&rdquo; replied Hammond; &ldquo;a briefless barrister, [Endnote:
      5] in fact, of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, who, having little or nothing to detain him
      at home, has come to spend a few idle months in seeing the new republic
      which has been made out of English substance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; continued Doctor Grim, not a whit relaxing the repulsiveness
      of his manner, and scowling askance at the stranger,&mdash;&ldquo;what may have
      drawn on me the good fortune of being compelled to make my time idle,
      because yours is so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger&rsquo;s cheek flushed a little; but he smiled to himself, as if
      saying that here was a grim, rude kind of humorist, who had lost the sense
      of his own peculiarity, and had no idea that he was rude at all. &ldquo;I came
      to America, as I told you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;chiefly because I was idle, and
      wanted to turn my enforced idleness to what profit I could, in the way of
      seeing men, manners, governments, and problems, which I hope to have no
      time to study by and by. But I also had an errand intrusted to me, and of
      a singular nature; and making inquiry in this little town (where my
      mission must be performed, if at all), I have been directed to you, by
      your townspeople, as to a person not unlikely to be able to assist me in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My townspeople, since you choose to call them so,&rdquo; answered the grim
      Doctor, &ldquo;ought to know, by this time, that I am not the sort of man likely
      to assist any person, in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet this is so singular an affair,&rdquo; said the stranger, still with mild
      courtesy, &ldquo;that at least it may excite your curiosity. I have come here to
      find a grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find a grave!&rdquo; said Doctor Grim, giving way to a grim sense of humor,
      and relaxing just enough to let out a joke, the tameness of which was a
      little redeemed, to his taste, by its grimness. &ldquo;I might help you there,
      to be sure, since it is all in the way of business. Like others of my
      profession, I have helped many people to find their graves, no doubt, and
      shall be happy to do the same for you. You have hit upon the one thing in
      which my services are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the young stranger, having tact enough to
      laugh at Dr. Grim&rsquo;s joke, and thereby mollifying him a little; &ldquo;but as far
      as I am personally concerned, I prefer to wait a while before making the
      discovery of that little spot in Mother Earth which I am destined to
      occupy. It is a grave which has been occupied as such for at least a
      century and a half which I am in quest of; and it is as an antiquarian, a
      genealogist, a person who has had dealings with the dead of long ago, not
      as a professional man engaged in adding to their number, that I ask your
      aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ahah!&rdquo; said the Doctor, laying down his pipe, and looking earnestly
      at the stranger; not kindly nor genially, but rather with a lurid glance
      of suspicion out of those red eyes of his, but no longer with a desire to
      escape an intruder; rather as one who meant to clutch him. &ldquo;Explain your
      meaning, sir, at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Hammond. &ldquo;There is an old English family, one
      of the members of which, very long ago, emigrated to this part of America,
      then a wilderness, and long afterwards a British colony. He was on ill
      terms with his family. There is reason to believe that documents, deeds,
      titular proofs, or some other thing valuable to the family, were buried in
      the grave of this emigrant; and there have been various attempts, within a
      century, to find this grave, and if possible some living descendant of the
      man, or both, under the idea that either of these cases might influence
      the disputed descent of the property, and enable the family to prove its
      claims to an ancient title. Now, rather as a matter of curiosity, than
      with any real hope of success,&mdash;and being slightly connected with the
      family,&mdash;I have taken what seems to myself a wild-goose chase; making
      it merely incidental, you well understand, not by any means the main
      purpose of my voyage to America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of this family?&rdquo; asked the Doctor, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man whose grave I seek,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;lived and died, in this
      country, under the assumed name of Colcord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you expect to succeed in this ridiculous quest?&rdquo; asked the Doctor,
      &ldquo;and what marks, signs, directions, have you to guide your search? And
      moreover, how have you come to any knowledge whatever about the matter,
      even that the emigrant ever assumed this name of Colcord, and that he was
      buried anywhere, and that his place of burial, after more than a century,
      is of the slightest importance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this was ascertained by a messenger on a similar errand with my own,
      only undertaken nearly a century ago, and more in earnest than I can
      pretend to be,&rdquo; replied the Englishman. &ldquo;At that period, however, there
      was probably a desire to find nothing that might take the hereditary
      possessions of the family out of the branch which still held them; and
      there is strong reason to suspect that the information acquired was
      purposely kept secret by the person in England into whose hands it came.
      The thing is differently situated now; the possessor of the estate is
      recently dead; and the discovery of an American heir would not be
      unacceptable to many. At all events, any knowledge gained here would throw
      light on a somewhat doubtful matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, as nearly as you can judge,&rdquo; said the Doctor, after a turn or two
      through the study, &ldquo;was this man buried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spent the last years of his life, certainly, in this town,&rdquo; said
      Hammond, &ldquo;and may be found, if at all, among the dead of that period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&mdash;their miserable dust, at least, which is all that still
      exists of them&mdash;were buried in the graveyard under these windows,&rdquo;
       said the Doctor. &ldquo;What marks, I say,&mdash;for you might as well seek a
      vanished wave of the sea, as a grave that surged upward so long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the gravestone,&rdquo; said Hammond, &ldquo;a slate one, there was rudely
      sculptured the impress of a foot. What it signifies I cannot conjecture,
      except it had some reference to a certain legend of a bloody footstep,
      which is currently told, and some token of which yet remains on one of the
      thresholds of the ancient mansion-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ned and Elsie had withdrawn themselves from the immediate vicinity of the
      fireside, and were playing at fox and geese in a corner near the window.
      But little Elsie, having very quick ears, and a faculty of attending to
      more affairs than one, now called out, &ldquo;Doctor Grim, Ned and I know where
      that gravestone is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Elsie,&rdquo; whispered Ned, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come forward here, both of you,&rdquo; said Doctor Grimshawe.

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two children approached, and stood before the Doctor and his guest,
      the latter of whom had not hitherto taken particular notice of them. He
      now looked from one to the other, with the pleasant, genial expression of
      a person gifted with a natural liking for children, and the freemasonry
      requisite to bring him acquainted with them; and it lighted up his face
      with a pleasant surprise to see two such beautiful specimens of boyhood
      and girlhood in this dismal, spider-haunted house, and under the
      guardianship of such a savage lout as the grim Doctor. He seemed
      particularly struck by the intelligence and sensibility of Ned&rsquo;s face, and
      met his eyes with a glance that Ned long afterwards remembered; but yet he
      seemed quite as much interested by Elsie, and gazed at her face with a
      perplexed, inquiring glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are fine children,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;May I ask if they are your own?&mdash;Pardon
      me if I ask amiss,&rdquo; added he, seeing a frown on the Doctor&rsquo;s brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask nothing about the brats,&rdquo; replied he grimly. &ldquo;Thank Heaven, they are
      not my children; so your question is answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I again ask pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Hammond. &ldquo;I am fond of children; and the
      boy has a singularly fine countenance; not in the least English. The true
      American face, no doubt. As to this sweet little girl, she impresses me
      with a vague resemblance to some person I have seen. Hers I should deem an
      English face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These children are not our topic,&rdquo; said the grim Doctor, with gruff
      impatience. &ldquo;If they are to be so, our conversation is ended. Ned, what do
      you know of this gravestone with the bloody foot on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a bloody foot, Doctor Grim,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;and I am not sure that
      it is a foot at all; only Elsie and I chose to fancy so, because of a
      story that we used to play at. But we were children then. The gravestone
      lies on the ground, within a little bit of a walk of our door; but this
      snow has covered it all over; else we might go out and see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go out at any rate,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;and if the Englishman
      chooses to come to America, he must take our snows as he finds them. Take
      your shovel, Ned, and if necessary we will uncover the gravestone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly muffled themselves in their warmest, and plunged forth
      through a back door into Ned and Elsie&rsquo;s playground, as the grim Doctor
      was wont to call it. The snow, except in one spot close at hand, lay deep,
      like cold oblivion, over the surging graves, and piled itself in drifted
      heaps against every stone that raised itself above the level; it filled
      enviously the letters of the inscriptions, enveloping all the dead in one
      great winding-sheet, whiter and colder than those which they had
      individually worn. The dreary space was pathless; not a footstep had
      tracked through the heavy snow; for it must be warm affection indeed that
      could so melt this wintry impression as to penetrate through the snow and
      frozen earth, and establish any warm thrills with the dead beneath:
      daisies, grass, genial earth, these allow of the magnetism of such
      sentiments; but winter sends them shivering back to the baffled heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ned,&rdquo; said the Doctor, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ned looked about him somewhat bewildered, and then pointed to a spot
      within not more than ten paces of the threshold which they had just
      crossed; and there appeared, not a gravestone, but a new grave (if any
      grave could be called new in that often-dug soil, made up of old
      mortality), an open hole, with the freshly-dug earth piled up beside it. A
      little snow (for there had been a gust or two since morning) appeared, as
      they peeped over the edge, to have fallen into it; but not enough to
      prevent a coffin from finding fit room and accommodation in it. But it was
      evident that the grave had been dug that very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The headstone, with the foot on it, was just here,&rdquo; said Ned, in much
      perplexity, &ldquo;and, as far as I can judge, the old sunken grave exactly
      marked out the space of this new one.&rdquo; [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shame,&rdquo; said Elsie, much shocked at the indecorum, &ldquo;that the new
      person should be thrust in here; for the old one was a friend of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has become of the headstone!&rdquo; exclaimed the young English
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      During their perplexity, a person had approached the group, wading through
      the snow from the gateway giving entrance from the street; a gaunt figure,
      with stooping shoulders, over one of which was a spade and some other tool
      fit for delving in the earth; and in his face there was the sort of keen,
      humorous twinkle that grave-diggers somehow seem to get, as if the
      dolorous character of their business necessitated something unlike itself
      by an inevitable reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Doctor,&rdquo; said he, with a shrewd wink in his face, &ldquo;are you looking
      for one of your patients? The man who is to be put to bed here was never
      caught in your spider&rsquo;s web.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doctor Grimshawe; &ldquo;when my patients have done with me, I leave
      them to you and the old Nick, and never trouble myself about them more.
      What I want to know is, why you have taken upon you to steal a man&rsquo;s
      grave, after he has had immemorial possession of it. By what right have
      you dug up this bed, undoing the work of a predecessor of yours, who has
      long since slept in one of his own furrows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Doctor,&rdquo; said the grave-digger, looking quietly into the cavernous
      pit which he had hollowed, &ldquo;it is against common sense that a dead man
      should think to keep a grave to himself longer than till you can take up
      his substance in a shovel. It would be a strange thing enough, if, when
      living families are turned out of their homes twice or thrice in a
      generation, (as they are likely to be in our new government,) a dead man
      should think he must sleep in one spot till the day of judgment. No; turn
      about, I say, to these old fellows. As long as they can decently be called
      dead men, I let them lie; when they are nothing but dust, I just take
      leave to stir them on occasion. This is the way we do things under the
      republic, whatever your customs be in the old country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matters are very much the same in any old English churchyard,&rdquo; said the
      English stranger. &ldquo;But, my good friend, I have come three thousand miles,
      partly to find this grave, and am a little disappointed to find my labor
      lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! and you are the man my father was looking for,&rdquo; said the
      grave-digger, nodding his head at Mr. Hammond. &ldquo;My father, who was a
      grave-digger afore me, died four and thirty years ago, when we were under
      the King; and says he, &lsquo;Ebenezer, do not you turn up a sod in this spot,
      till you have turned up every other in the ground.&rsquo; And I have always
      obeyed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was the reason of such a singular prohibition?&rdquo; asked Hammond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father knew,&rdquo; said the grave-digger, &ldquo;and he told me the reason too;
      but since we are under the republic, we have given up remembering those
      old-world legends, as we used to. The newspapers keep us from talking in
      the chimney-corner; and so things go out of our minds. An old man, with
      his stories of what he has seen, and what his great-grandfather saw before
      him, is of little account since newspapers came up. Stop&mdash;I remember&mdash;no,
      I forget,&mdash;it was something about the grave holding a witness, who
      had been sought before and might be again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is all you know about it?&rdquo; said Hammond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All,&mdash;every mite,&rdquo; said the old grave-digger. &ldquo;But my father knew,
      and would have been glad to tell you the whole story. There was a great
      deal of wisdom and knowledge, about graves especially, buried out yonder
      where my old father was put away, before the Stamp Act was thought of. But
      it is no great matter, I suppose. People don&rsquo;t care about old graves in
      these times. They just live, and put the dead out of sight and out of
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; but what have you done with the headstone?&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;You
      can&rsquo;t have eaten it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Doctor,&rdquo; said the grave-digger, laughing; &ldquo;it would crack better
      teeth than mine, old and crumbly as it is. And yet I meant to do something
      with it that is akin to eating; for my oven needs a new floor, and I
      thought to take this stone, which would stand the fire well. But here,&rdquo;
       continued he, scraping away the snow with his shovel, a task in which
      little Ned gave his assistance,&mdash;&ldquo;here is the headstone, just as I
      have always seen it, and as my father saw it before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ancient memorial, being cleared of snow, proved to be a slab of
      freestone, with some rude traces of carving in bas-relief around the
      border, now much effaced, and an impression, which seemed to be as much
      like a human foot as anything else, sunk into the slab; but this device
      was wrought in a much more clumsy way than the ornamented border, and
      evidently by an unskilful hand. Beneath was an inscription, over which the
      hard, flat lichens had grown, and done their best to obliterate it,
      although the following words might be written [Endnote: 2] or guessed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here lyeth the mortal part of Thomas Colcord, an upright man, of tender
      and devout soul, who departed this troublous life September ye nineteenth,
      1667, aged 57 years and nine months. Happier in his death than in his
      lifetime. Let his bones be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name, Colcord, was somewhat defaced; it was impossible, in the general
      disintegration of the stone, to tell whether wantonly, or with a purpose
      of altering and correcting some error in the spelling, or, as occurred to
      Hammond, to change the name entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very unsatisfactory,&rdquo; said Hammond, &ldquo;but very curious, too. But
      this certainly is the impress of what was meant for a human foot, and
      coincides strangely with the legend of the Bloody Footstep,&mdash;the mark
      of the foot that trod in the blessed King Charles&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that matter,&rdquo; said the grave-digger, &ldquo;it comes into my mind that my
      father used to call it the stamp of Satan&rsquo;s foot, because he claimed the
      dead man for his own. It is plain to see that there was a deep deft
      between two of the toes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two ways of telling that legend,&rdquo; remarked the Doctor. &ldquo;But did
      you find nothing in the grave, Hewen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes,&mdash;a bone or two,&mdash;as much as could be expected after
      above a hundred years,&rdquo; said the grave-digger. &ldquo;I tossed them aside; and
      if you are curious about them, you will find them when the snow melts.
      That was all; and it would have been unreasonable in old Colcord&mdash;especially
      in these republican times&mdash;to have wanted to keep his grave any
      longer, when there was so little of him left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must drop the matter here, then,&rdquo; said Hammond, with a sigh. &ldquo;Here, my
      friend, is a trifle for your trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble,&rdquo; said the grave-digger, &ldquo;and in these republican times we
      can&rsquo;t take anything for nothing, because it won&rsquo;t do for a poor man to
      take off his hat and say thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he did take the silver, and winked a sort of acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor, with unwonted hospitality, invited the English stranger to
      dine in his house; and though there was no pretence of cordiality in the
      invitation, Mr. Hammond accepted it, being probably influenced by
      curiosity to make out some definite idea of the strange household in which
      he found himself. Doctor Grimshawe having taken it upon him to be host,&mdash;for,
      up to this time, the stranger stood upon his own responsibility, and,
      having voluntarily presented himself to the Doctor, had only himself to
      thank for any scant courtesy he might meet,&mdash;but now the grim Doctor
      became genial after his own fashion. At dinner he produced a bottle of
      port, which made the young Englishman almost fancy himself on the other
      side of the water; and he entered into a conversation, which I fancy was
      the chief object which the grim Doctor had in view in showing himself in
      so amiable a light, [Endnote: 3] for in the course of it the stranger was
      insensibly led to disclose many things, as it were of his own accord,
      relating to the part of England whence he came, and especially to the
      estate and family which have been before mentioned,&mdash;the present
      state of that family, together with other things that he seemed to himself
      to pour out naturally,&mdash;for, at last, he drew himself up, and
      attempted an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your good wine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or the unexpected accident of meeting a
      countryman, has made me unusually talkative, and on subjects, I fear,
      which have not a particular interest for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not quite succeeded in shaking off my country, as you see,&rdquo; said
      Doctor Grimshawe, &ldquo;though I neither expect nor wish ever to see it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something rather ungracious in the grim Doctor&rsquo;s response, and
      as they now adjourned to his study, and the Doctor betook himself to his
      pipe and tumbler, the young Englishman sought to increase his acquaintance
      with the two children, both of whom showed themselves graciously inclined
      towards him; more warmly so than they had been to the schoolmaster, as he
      was the only other guest whom they had ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to see England, my little fellow?&rdquo; he inquired of Ned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very much! more than anything else in the world,&rdquo; replied the boy,
      his eyes gleaming and his cheeks flushing with the earnestness of his
      response; for, indeed, the question stirred up all the dreams and reveries
      which the child had cherished, far back into the dim regions of his
      memory. After what the Doctor had told him of his origin, he had never
      felt any home feeling here; it seemed to him that he was wandering Ned,
      whom the wind had blown from afar. Somehow or other, from many
      circumstances which he put together and seethed in his own childish
      imagination, it seemed to him that he was to go back to that far old
      country, and there wander among the green, ivy-grown, venerable scenes;
      the older he grew, the more his mind took depth, the stronger was this
      fancy in him; though even to Elsie he had scarcely breathed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So strong a desire,&rdquo; said the stranger, smiling at his earnestness, &ldquo;will
      be sure to work out its own accomplishment. I shall meet you in England,
      my young friend, one day or another. And you, my little girl, are you as
      anxious to see England as your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned is not my brother,&rdquo; said little Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor here interposed some remark on a different subject; for it was
      observable that he never liked to have the conversation turn on these
      children, their parentage, or relations to each other or himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were sent to bed; and the young Englishman, finding the
      conversation lag, and his host becoming gruffer and less communicative
      than he thought quite courteous, retired. But before he went, however, he
      could not refrain from making a remark on the gigantic spider, which was
      swinging like a pendulum above the Doctor&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a singular pet!&rdquo; said he; for the nervous part of him had latterly
      been getting uppermost, so that it disturbed him; in fact, the spider
      above and the grim man below equally disturbed him. &ldquo;Are you a naturalist?
      Have you noted his habits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;I have learned from his web how to weave a plot,
      and how to catch my victim and devour him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said the Englishman, as he issued forth into the cold gray
      night, &ldquo;I have escaped the grim fellow&rsquo;s web, at all events. How strange a
      group,&mdash;those two sweet children, that grim old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As regards this matter of the ancient grave, it remains to be recorded,
      that, when the snow melted, little Ned and Elsie went to look at the spot,
      where, by this time, there was a little hillock with the brown sods laid
      duly upon it, which the coming spring would make green. By the side of it
      they saw, with more curiosity than repugnance, a few fragments of crumbly
      bones, which they plausibly conjectured to have appertained to some part
      of the framework of the ancient Colcord, wherewith he had walked through
      the troublous life of which his gravestone spoke. And little Elsie, whose
      eyes were very sharp, and her observant qualities of the quickest, found
      something which Ned at first pronounced to be only a bit of old iron,
      incrusted with earth; but Elsie persisted to knock off some of the earth
      that seemed to have incrusted it, and discovered a key. The children ran
      with their prize to the grim Doctor, who took it between his thumb and
      finger, turned it over and over, and then proceeded to rub it with a
      chemical substance which soon made it bright. It proved to be a silver
      key, of antique and curious workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps this is what Mr. Hammond was in search of,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;What a
      pity he is gone! Perhaps we can send it after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the gruff Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And attaching the key to a chain, which he took from a drawer, and which
      seemed to be gold, he hung it round Ned&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you find a lock for this key,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;open it, and consider
      yourself heir of whatever treasure is revealed there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ned continued that sad, fatal habit of growing out of childhood, as boys
      will, until he was now about ten years old, and little Elsie as much as
      six or seven. He looked healthy, but pale; something there was in the
      character and influences of his life that made him look as if he were
      growing up in a shadow, with less sunshine than he needed for a robust and
      exuberant development, though enough to make his intellectual growth tend
      towards a little luxuriance, in some directions. He was likely to turn out
      a fanciful, perhaps a poetic youth; young as he was, there had been
      already discoveries, on the grim Doctor&rsquo;s part, of certain blotted and
      clumsily scrawled scraps of paper, the chirography on which was arrayed in
      marshalled lines of unequal length, and each commanded by a capital letter
      and marching on from six to ten lame feet. Doctor Grim inspected these
      things curiously, and to say the truth most scornfully, before he took
      them to light his pipe withal; but they told him little as regarded this
      boy&rsquo;s internal state, being mere echoes, and very lugubrious ones, of
      poetic strains that were floating about in the atmosphere of that day,
      long before any now remembered bard had begun to sing. But there were the
      rudiments of a poetic and imaginative mind within the boy, if its
      subsequent culture should be such as the growth of that delicate flower
      requires; a brooding habit taking outward things into itself and imbuing
      them with its own essence until, after they had lain there awhile, they
      assumed a relation both to truth and to himself, and became mediums to
      affect other minds with the magnetism of his own. He lived far too much an
      inward life for healthfulness, at his age; the peculiarity of his
      situation, a child of mystery, with certain reaches and vistas that seemed
      to promise a bright solution of his mystery, keeping his imagination
      always awake and strong. That castle in the air,&mdash;so much more vivid
      than other castles, because it had perhaps a real substance of ancient,
      ivy-grown, hewn stone somewhere,&mdash;that visionary hall in England,
      with its surrounding woods and fine lawns, and the beckoning shadows at
      the ancient windows, and that fearful threshold, with the blood still
      glistening on it,&mdash;he dwelt and wandered so much there, that he had
      no real life in the sombre house on the corner of the graveyard; except
      that the loneliness of the latter, and the grim Doctor with his grotesque
      surroundings, and then the great ugly spider, and that odd, inhuman
      mixture of crusty Hannah, all served to remove him out of the influences
      of common life. Little Elsie was all that he had to keep life real, and
      substantial; and she, a child so much younger than he, was influenced by
      the same circumstances, and still more by himself, so that, as far as he
      could impart himself to her, he led her hand in hand through the same
      dream-scenery amid which he strayed himself. They knew not another child
      in town; the grim Doctor was their only friend. As for Ned, this seclusion
      had its customary and normal effect upon him; it had made him think
      ridiculously high of his own gifts, powers, attainments, and at the same
      time doubt whether they would pass with those of others; it made him
      despise all flesh, as if he were of a superior race, and yet have an idle
      and weak fear of coming in contact with them, from a dread of his
      incompetency to cope with them; so he at once depreciated and exalted, to
      an absurd degree, both himself and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said the Doctor to him one day, in his gruffest tone, &ldquo;you are not
      turning out to be the boy I looked for and meant to make. I have given you
      sturdy English instruction, and solidly grounded you in matters that the
      poor superficial people and time merely skim over; I looked to see the
      rudiments of a man in you, by this time; and you begin to mope and pule as
      if your babyhood were coming back on you. You seem to think more than a
      boy of your years should; and yet it is not manly thought, nor ever will
      be so. What do you mean, boy, by making all my care of you come to
      nothing, in this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do my best, Doctor Grim,&rdquo; said Ned, with sullen dignity. &ldquo;What you
      teach me, I learn. What more can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, my fine fellow,&rdquo; quoth Doctor Grim, getting rude, as
      was his habit. &ldquo;You disappoint me, and I&rsquo;ll not bear it. I want you to be
      a man; and I&rsquo;ll have you a man or nothing. If I had foreboded such a
      fellow as you turn out to be, I never would have taken you from the place
      where, as I once told you, I found you,&mdash;the almshouse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Doctor Grim, Doctor Grim!&rdquo; cried little Elsie, in a tone of grief and
      bitter reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ned had risen slowly, as the Doctor uttered those last words, turning as
      white as a sheet, and stood gazing at him, with large eyes, in which there
      was a calm upbraiding; a strange dignity was in his childish aspect, which
      was no longer childish, but seemed to have grown older all in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; added the Doctor, incensed at the boy&rsquo;s aspect, &ldquo;there is nonsense
      that ought to be whipt out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said enough, sir,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Would to God you had left me
      where you found me![Endnote: 4] It was not my fault that you took me from
      the alms-house. But it will be my fault if I ever eat another bit of your
      bread, or stay under your roof an hour longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was moving towards the door, but little Elsie sprung upon him and
      caught him round the neck, although he repelled her with severe dignity;
      and Doctor Grimshawe, after a look at the group in which a bitter sort of
      mirth and mischief struggled with a better and kindlier sentiment, at last
      flung his pipe into the chimney, hastily quaffed the remnant of a tumbler,
      and shuffled after Ned, kicking off his old slippers in his hurry. He
      caught the boy just by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned, Ned, my boy, I&rsquo;m sorry for what I said,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I am a guzzling
      old blockhead, and don&rsquo;t know how to treat a gentleman when he honors me
      with his company. It is not in my blood nor breeding to have such
      knowledge. Ned, you will make a man, and I lied if I said otherwise. Come,
      I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was easily touched, at these years, as a boy ought to be; and
      though he had not yet forgiven the grim Doctor, the tears, to his especial
      shame, gushed out of his eyes in a torrent, and his whole frame shook with
      sobs. The Doctor caught him in his arms, and hugged him to his old
      tobacco-fragrant dressing-gown, hugged him like a bear, as he was; so that
      poor Ned hardly knew whether he was embracing him with his love, or
      squeezing him to death in his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to live a great while longer; I seem an
      eternal nuisance to you, I know; but it&rsquo;s not so, I&rsquo;m mortal and I feel
      myself breaking up. Let us be friends while I live; for believe me, Ned,
      I&rsquo;ve done as well by you as I knew, and care for nothing, love nothing, so
      much as you. Little Elsie here, yes. I love her too. But that&rsquo;s different.
      You are a boy, and will be a man; and a man whom I destine to do for me
      what it has been the object of my life to achieve. Let us be friends. We
      will&mdash;we must be friends; and when old Doctor Grim, worthless wretch
      that he is, sleeps in his grave, you shall not have the pang of having
      parted from him in unkindness. Forgive me, Ned; and not only that, but
      love me better than ever; for though I am a hasty old wretch, I am not
      altogether evil as regards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I know not whether the Doctor would have said all this, if the day had not
      been pretty well advanced, and if his potations had not been many; but, at
      any rate, he spoke no more than he felt, and his emotions thrilled through
      the sensitive system of the boy, and quite melted him down. He forgave
      Doctor Grim, and, as he asked, loved him better than ever; and so did
      Elsie. Then it was so sweet, so good, to have had this one outgush of
      affection,&mdash;he, poor child, who had no memory of mother&rsquo;s kisses, or
      of being cared for out of tenderness, and whose heart had been hungry, all
      his life, for some such thing; and probably Doctor Grim, in his way, had
      the same kind of enjoyment of this passionate crisis; so that though, the
      next day, they all three looked at one another a little ashamed, yet it
      had some remote analogy to that delicious embarrassment of two lovers, at
      their first meeting after they know all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is very remarkable that Ned had so much good in him as we find there;
      in the first place, born as he seemed to be of a wild, vagrant stock, a
      seedling sown by the breezes, and falling among the rocks and sands; the
      growing up without a mother to cultivate his tenderness with kisses and
      the inestimable, inevitable love of love breaking out on all little
      occasions, without reference to merit or demerit, unfailing whether or no;
      mother&rsquo;s faith in excellences, the buds which were yet invisible to all
      other eyes, but to which her warm faith was the genial sunshine necessary
      to their growth; mother&rsquo;s generous interpretation of all that was doubtful
      in him, and which might turn out good or bad, according as should be
      believed of it; mother&rsquo;s pride in whatever the boy accomplished, and
      unfailing excuses, explanations, apologies, so satisfactory, for all his
      failures; mother&rsquo;s deep intuitive insight, which should see the permanent
      good beneath all the appearance of temporary evil, being wiser through her
      love than the wisest sage could be,&mdash;the dullest, homeliest mother
      than the wisest sage. The Creator, apparently, has set a little of his own
      infinite wisdom and love (which are one) in a mother&rsquo;s heart, so that no
      child, in the common course of things, should grow up without some
      heavenly instruction. Instead of all this, and the vast deal more that
      mothers do for children, there had been only the gruff, passionate Doctor,
      without sense of religion, with only a fitful tenderness, with years&rsquo; 
      length between the fits, so fiercely critical, so wholly unradiant of
      hope, misanthropic, savagely morbid. Yes; there was little Elsie too; it
      must have been that she was the boy&rsquo;s preserver, being childhood,
      sisterhood, womanhood, all that there had been for him of human life, and
      enough&mdash;he being naturally of such good stuff&mdash;to keep him good.
      He had lost much, but not all: he was not nearly what he might have been
      under better auspices; flaws and imperfections there were, in abundance,
      great uncultivated wastes and wildernesses in his moral nature, tangled
      wilds where there might have been stately, venerable religious groves; but
      there was no rank growth of evil. That unknown mother, that had no
      opportunity to nurse her boy, must have had gentle and noblest qualities
      to endow him with; a noble father, too, a long, unstained descent, one
      would have thought. Was this an almshouse child?
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Grim knew, very probably, that there was all this on the womanly
      side that was wanting to Ned&rsquo;s occasion; and very probably, too, being a
      man not without insight, he was aware that tender treatment, as a mother
      bestows it, tends likewise to foster strength, and manliness of character,
      as well as softer developments; but all this he could not have supplied,
      and now as little as ever. But there was something else which Ned ought to
      have, and might have; and this was intercourse with his kind, free
      circulation, free air, instead of the stived-up house, with the breeze
      from the graveyard blowing over it,&mdash;to be drawn out of himself, and
      made to share the life of many, to be introduced, at one remove, to the
      world with which he was to contend. To this end, shortly after the scene
      of passion and reconciliation above described, the Doctor took the
      resolution of sending Ned to an academy, famous in that day, and still
      extant. Accordingly they all three&mdash;the grim Doctor, Ned, and Elsie&mdash;set
      forth, one day of spring, leaving the house to crusty Hannah and the great
      spider, in a carryall, being the only excursion involving a night&rsquo;s
      absence that either of the two children remembered from the house by the
      graveyard, as at nightfall they saw the modest pine-built edifice, with
      its cupola and bell, where Ned was to be initiated into the schoolboy. The
      Doctor, remembering perhaps days spent in some gray, stately, legendary
      great school of England, instinct with the boyhood of men afterwards
      great, puffed forth a depreciating curse upon it; but nevertheless made
      all arrangements for Ned&rsquo;s behoof, and next morning prepared to leave him
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned, my son, good by,&rdquo; cried he, shaking the little fellow&rsquo;s hand as he
      stood tearful and wistful beside the chaise shivering at the loneliness
      which he felt settling around him,&mdash;a new loneliness to him,&mdash;the
      loneliness of a crowd. &ldquo;Do not be cast down, my boy. Face the world; grasp
      the thistle strongly, and it will sting you the less. Have faith in your
      own fist! Fear no man! Have no secret plot! Never do what you think wrong!
      If hereafter you learn to know that Doctor Grim was a bad man, forgive
      him, and be a better one yourself. Good by, and if my blessing be good for
      anything, in God&rsquo;s name, I invoke it upon you heartily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Elsie was sobbing, and flung her arms about Ned&rsquo;s neck, and he his
      about hers; so that they parted without a word. As they drove away, a
      singular sort of presentiment came over the boy, as he stood looking after
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all over,&mdash;all over,&rdquo; said he to himself: &ldquo;Doctor Grim and
      little Elsie are gone out of my life. They leave me and will never come
      back,&mdash;not they to me, not I to them. O, how cold the world is! Would
      we three&mdash;the Doctor, and Elsie, and I&mdash;could have lain down in
      a row, in the old graveyard, close under the eaves of the house, and let
      the grass grow over us. The world is cold; and I am an alms-house child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house by the graveyard seemed dismal now, no doubt, to little Elsie,
      who, being of a cheerful nature herself, (common natures often having this
      delusion about a home,) had grown up with the idea that it was the most
      delightful spot in the world; the place fullest of pleasant play, and of
      household love (because her own love welled over out of her heart, like a
      spring in a barrel); the place where everybody was kind and good, the
      world beyond its threshold appearing perhaps strange and sombre; the spot
      where it was pleasantest to be, for its own mere sake; the dim old, homely
      place, so warm and cosey in winter, so cool in summer. Who else was
      fortunate enough to have such a home,&mdash;with that nice, kind,
      beautiful Ned, and that dear, kind, gentle, old Doctor Grim, with his
      sweet ways, so wise, so upright, so good, beyond all other men? O, happy
      girl that she was, to have grown up in such a home! Was there ever any
      other house with such cosey nooks in it? Such probably were the feelings
      of good little Elsie about this place, which has seemed to us so dismal;
      for the home feeling in the child&rsquo;s heart, her warm, cheerful,
      affectionate nature, was a magic, so far as she herself was concerned, and
      made all the house and its inmates over after her own fashion. But now
      that little Ned was gone, there came a change. She moped about the house,
      and, for the first time, suspected it was dismal.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the grim Doctor, there did not appear to be much alteration in that
      hard old character; perhaps he drank a little more, though that was
      doubtful, because it is difficult to see where he could find niches to
      stick in more frequent drinks. Nor did he more frequently breathe through
      the pipe. He fell into desuetude, however, of his daily walk, [Endnote: 1]
      and sent Elsie to play by herself in the graveyard (a dreary business
      enough for the poor child) instead of taking her to country or seaside
      himself. He was more savage and blasphemous, sometimes, than he had been
      heretofore known to be; but, on the other hand, he was sometimes softer,
      with a kind of weary consenting to circumstances, intervals of helpless
      resignation, when he no longer fought and struggled in his heart. He did
      not seem to be alive all the time; but, on the other hand, he was
      sometimes a good deal too much alive, and could not bear his potations as
      well as he used to do, and was overheard blaspheming at himself for being
      so weakly, and having a brain that could not bear a thimbleful, and
      growing to be a milksop like Colcord, as he said. This person, of whom the
      Doctor and his young people had had such a brief experience, appeared
      nevertheless to hang upon his remembrance in a singular way,&mdash;the
      more singular as there was little resemblance between them, or apparent
      possibility of sympathy. Little Elsie was startled to hear Doctor Grim
      sometimes call out, &ldquo;Colcord! Colcord!&rdquo; as if he were summoning a spirit
      from some secret place. He muttered, sitting by himself, long, indistinct
      masses of talk, in which this name was discernible, and other names. Going
      on mumbling, by the hour together, great masses of vague trouble, in
      which, if it only could have been unravelled and put in order, no doubt
      all the secrets of his life,&mdash;secrets of wrath, guilt, vengeance,
      love, hatred, all beaten up together, and the best quite spoiled by the
      worst, might have been found. His mind evidently wandered. Sometimes, he
      seemed to be holding conversation with unseen interlocutors, and almost
      invariably, so far as could be gathered, he was bitter, and then sat,
      immitigable, pouring out wrath and terror, denunciating, tyrannical,
      speaking as to something that lay at his feet, but which he would not
      spare. [Endnote: 2] Then suddenly, he would start, look round the dark old
      study, upward to the dangling spider overhead, and then at the quiet
      little girl, who, try as she might, could not keep her affrighted looks
      from his face, and always met his eyes with a loyal frankness and
      unyielded faith in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you little jade, what have you been overhearing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Doctor Grim,&mdash;nothing that I could make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make out as much as you can,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am not afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of little Elsie, dear Doctor Grim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither of you, nor of the Devil,&rdquo; murmured the Doctor,&mdash;&ldquo;of nobody
      but little Ned and that milksop Colcord. If I have wronged anybody it is
      them. As for the rest, let the day of judgment come. Doctor Grim is ready
      to fling down his burden at the judgment seat and have it sorted there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he would lie back in his chair and look up at the great spider, who
      (or else it was Elsie&rsquo;s fancy) seemed to be making great haste in those
      days, filling out his web as if he had less time than was desirable for
      such a piece of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning the Doctor arose as usual, and after breakfast (at which he
      ate nothing, and even after filling his coffee-cup half with brandy, half
      with coffee, left it untouched, save sipping a little out of a teaspoon)
      he went to the study (with a rather unsteady gait, chiefly remarkable
      because it was so early in the day), and there established himself with
      his pipe, as usual, and his medical books and machines, and his
      manuscript. But he seemed troubled, irresolute, weak, and at last he blew
      out a volley of oaths, with no apparent appropriateness, and then seemed
      to be communing with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use to carry this on any further,&rdquo; said he, fiercely, in a
      decided tone, as if he had taken a resolution. &ldquo;Elsie, my girl, come and
      kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Elsie kissed him, amid all the tobacco-smoke which was curling out of
      his mouth, as if there were a half-extinguished furnace in his inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsie, my little girl, I mean to die to-day,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To die, dear Doctor Grim? O, no! O, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes! Elsie,&rdquo; said the Doctor, in a very positive tone. &ldquo;I have kept
      myself alive by main force these three weeks, and I find it hardly worth
      the trouble. It requires so much exercise of will;&mdash;and I am weary,
      weary. The pipe does not taste good, the brandy bewilders me. Ned is gone,
      too;&mdash;I have nothing else to do. I have wrought this many a year for
      an object, and now, taking all things into consideration, I don&rsquo;t know
      whether to execute it or no. Ned is gone; there is nobody but my little
      Elsie,&mdash;a good child, but not quite enough to live for. I will let
      myself die, therefore, before sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no! Doctor Grim. Let us send for Ned, and you will think it worth the
      trouble of living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Elsie, I want no one near my death-bed; when I have finished a little
      business, you must go out of the room, and I will turn my face to the
      wall, and say good-night. But first send crusty Hannah for Mr. Pickering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a lawyer of the town, a man of classical and antiquarian tastes, as
      well as legal acquirement, and some of whose pursuits had brought him and
      Doctor Grim occasionally together. Besides calling this gentleman, crusty
      Hannah (of her own motion, but whether out of good will to the poor Doctor
      Grim, or from a tendency to mischief inherent in such unnatural mixtures
      as hers) summoned, likewise, in all haste, a medical man,&mdash;and, as it
      happened, the one who had taken a most decidedly hostile part to our
      Doctor,&mdash;and a clergyman, who had often devoted our poor friend to
      the infernal regions, almost by name, in his sermons; a kindness, to say
      the truth, which the Doctor had fully reciprocated in many anathemas
      against the clergyman. These two worthies, arriving simultaneously, and in
      great haste, were forthwith ushered to where the Doctor lay half reclining
      in his study; and upon showing their heads, the Doctor flew into an awful
      rage, threatening, in his customary improper way, when angry, to make them
      smell the infernal regions, and proceeding to put his threats into
      execution by flinging his odorous tobacco-pipe in the face of the medical
      man, and rebaptizing the clergyman with a half-emptied tumbler of brandy
      and water, and sending a terrible vociferation of oaths after them both,
      as they clattered hastily down the stairs. Really, that crusty Hannah must
      have been the Devil, for she stood grinning and chuckling at the foot of
      the stairs, curtseying grotesquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He terrible man, our old Doctor Grim,&rdquo; quoth crusty Hannah. &ldquo;He drive us
      all to the wicked place before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was the final outbreak of poor Doctor Grim. Indeed, he
      almost went off at once in the exhaustion that succeeded. The lawyer
      arrived shortly after, and was shut up with him for a considerable space;
      after which crusty Hannah was summoned, and desired to call two
      indifferent persons from the street, as witnesses to a will; and this
      document was duly executed, and given into the possession of the lawyer.
      This done, and the lawyer having taken his leave, the grim Doctor desired,
      and indeed commanded imperatively, that crusty Hannah should quit the
      room, having first&mdash;we are sorry to say&mdash;placed the
      brandy-bottle within reach of his hand, and leaving him propped up in his
      arm-chair, in which he leaned back, gazing up at the great spider, who
      was, dangling overhead. As the door closed behind crusty Hannah&rsquo;s grinning
      and yet strangely interested face, the Doctor caught a glimpse of little
      Elsie in the passage, bathed in tears, and lingering and looking earnestly
      into the chamber. [Endnote: 3.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the poor little girl, the Doctor cried out to her, half wrathfully,
      half tenderly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, you little wretch! Come and kiss me once more.&rdquo;
       So Elsie, restraining her grief with a great effort, ran to him and gave
      him a last kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Ned,&rdquo; said the Doctor solemnly, &ldquo;to think no more of the old English
      hall, or of the bloody footstep, or of the silver key, or any of all that
      nonsense. Good by, my dear!&rdquo; Then he said, with his thunderous and
      imperative tone, &ldquo;Let no one come near me till to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that parting was over; but still the poor little desolate child hovered
      by the study door all day long, afraid to enter, afraid to disobey, but
      unable to go. Sometimes she heard the Doctor muttering, as was his wont;
      once she fancied he was praying, and dropping on her knees, she also
      prayed fervently, and perhaps acceptably; then, all at once, the Doctor
      called out, in a loud voice, &ldquo;No, Ned, no. Drop it, drop it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then there was an utter silence, unbroken forevermore by the lips that
      had uttered so many objectionable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, after an interval which had been prescribed by the grim
      Doctor, a messenger was sent by the lawyer to our friend Ned, to inform
      him of this sad event, and to bring him back temporarily to town, for the
      purpose of hearing what were his prospects, and what disposition was now
      to be made of him. We shall not attempt to describe the grief,
      astonishment, and almost incredulity of Ned, on discovering that a person
      so mixed up with and built into his whole life as the stalwart Doctor
      Grimshawe had vanished out of it thus unexpectedly, like something thin as
      a vapor,&mdash;like a red flame, that one [instant] is very bright in its
      lurid ray, and then is nothing at all, amid the darkness. To the poor
      boy&rsquo;s still further grief and astonishment, he found, on reaching the spot
      that he called home, that little Elsie (as the lawyer gave him to
      understand, by the express orders of the Doctor, and for reasons of great
      weight) had been conveyed away by a person under whose guardianship she
      was placed, and that Ned could not be informed of the place. Even crusty
      Hannah had been provided for and disposed of, and was no longer to be
      found. Mr. Pickering explained to Ned the dispositions in his favor which
      had been made by his deceased friend, who, out of a moderate property, had
      left him the means of obtaining as complete an education as the country
      would afford, and of supporting himself until his own exertions would be
      likely to give him the success which his abilities were calculated to win.
      The remainder of his property (a less sum than that thus disposed of) was
      given to little Elsie, with the exception of a small provision to crusty
      Hannah, with the recommendation from the Doctor that she should retire and
      spend the remainder of her life among her own people. There was likewise a
      certain sum left for the purpose of editing and printing (with a
      dedication to the Medical Society of the State) an account of the process
      of distilling balm from cobwebs; the bequest being worded in so singular a
      way that it was just as impossible as it had ever been to discover whether
      the grim Doctor was in earnest or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      What disappointed the boy, in a greater degree than we shall try to
      express, was the lack of anything in reference to those dreams and castles
      of the air,&mdash;any explanation of his birth; so that he was left with
      no trace of it, except just so far as the alms-house whence the Doctor had
      taken him. There all traces of his name and descent vanished, just as if
      he had been made up of the air, as an aerolite seems to be before it
      tumbles on the earth with its mysterious iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor boy, in his bewilderment, had not yet come to feel what his grief
      was; it was not to be conceived, in a few days, that he was deprived of
      every person, thing, or thought that had hitherto kept his heart warm. He
      tried to make himself feel it, yearning for this grief as for his sole
      friend. Being, for the present, domiciled with the lawyer, he obtained the
      key of his former home, and went through the desolate house that he knew
      so well, and which now had such a silent, cold, familiar strangeness, with
      none in it, though the ghosts of the grim Doctor, of laughing little
      Elsie, of crusty Hannah,&mdash;dead and alive alike,&mdash;were all there,
      and his own ghost among them; for he himself was dead, that is, his former
      self, which he recognized as himself, had passed away, as they were. In
      the study everything looked as formerly, yet with a sort of unreality, as
      if it would dissolve and vanish on being touched; and, indeed, it partly
      proved so; for over the Doctor&rsquo;s chair seemed still to hang the great
      spider, but on looking closer at it, and finally touching it with the end
      of the Doctor&rsquo;s stick, Ned discovered that it was merely the skin, shell,
      apparition, of the real spider,[Endnote: 4] the reality of whom, it is to
      be supposed, had followed the grim Doctor, whithersoever he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought struck Ned while he was here; he remembered the secret niche in
      the wall, where he had once seen the Doctor deposit some papers. He
      looked, and there they were. Who was the heir of those papers, if not he?
      If there were anything wrong in appropriating them, it was not perceptible
      to him in the desolation, anxiety, bewilderment, and despair of that
      moment. He grasped the papers, and hurried from the room and down the
      stairs, afraid to look round, and half expecting to hear the gruff voice
      of Doctor Grim thundering after him to bring them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ned went out of the back door, and found his way to the Doctor&rsquo;s new
      grave, which, as it happened, was dug close beside that one which occupied
      the place of the one which the stranger had come to seek; and, as if to
      spite the Doctor&rsquo;s professional antipathies, it lay beside a grave of an
      old physician and surgeon, one Doctor Summerton, who used to help diseases
      and kill patients above a hundred years ago. But Doctor Grim was
      undisturbed by these neighbors, and apparently not more by the grief of
      poor little Ned, who hid his face in the crumbly earth of the grave, and
      the sods that had not begun to grow, and wept as if his heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the heart never breaks on the first grave; and, after many graves, it
      gets so obtuse that nothing can break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let the mists settle down over the trail of our story, hiding it
      utterly on its onward course, for a long way to come, until, after many
      years, they may disperse and discover something which, were it worth while
      to follow it through all that obscurity, would prove to be the very same
      track which that boy was treading when we last saw him,&mdash;though it
      may have lain over land and sea since then; but the footsteps that trod
      there are treading here.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is&mdash;or there was, now many years ago, and a few years also it
      was still extant&mdash;a chamber, which when I think of, it seems to me
      like entering a deep recess of my own consciousness, a deep cave of my
      nature; so much have I thought of it and its inmate, through a
      considerable period of my life. After I had seen it long in fancy, then I
      saw it in reality, with my waking eyes; and questioned with myself whether
      I was really awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that it was a picturesque or stately chamber; not in the least. It was
      dim, dim as a melancholy mood; so dim, to come to particulars, that, till
      you were accustomed to that twilight medium, the print of a book looked
      all blurred; a pin was an indistinguishable object; the face of your
      familiar friend, or your dearest beloved one, would be unrecognizable
      across it, and the figures, so warm and radiant with life and heart, would
      seem like the faint gray shadows of our thoughts, brooding in age over
      youthful images of joy and love. Nevertheless, the chamber, though so
      difficult to see across, was small. You detected that it was within very
      narrow boundaries, though you could not precisely see them; only you felt
      yourself shut in, compressed, impeded, in the deep centre of something;
      and you longed for a breath of fresh air. Some articles of furniture there
      seemed to be; but in this dim medium, to which we are unaccustomed, it is
      not well to try to make out what they were, or anything else&mdash;now at
      least&mdash;about the chamber. Only one thing; small as the light was, it
      was rather wonderful how there came to be any; for no windows were
      apparent; no communication with the outward day. [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking into this chamber, in fancy it is some time before we who come out
      of the broad sunny daylight of the world discover that it has an inmate.
      Yes, there is some one within, but where? We know it; but do not precisely
      see him, only a presence is impressed upon us. It is in that corner; no,
      not there; only a heap of darkness and an old antique coffer, that, as we
      look closely at it, seems to be made of carved wood. Ah! he is in that
      other dim corner; and now that we steal close to him, we see him; a young
      man, pale, flung upon a sort of mattress-couch. He seems in alarm at
      something or other. He trembles, he listens, as if for voices. It must be
      a great peril, indeed, that can haunt him thus and make him feel afraid in
      such a seclusion as you feel this to be; but there he is, tremulous, and
      so pale that really his face is almost visible in the gloomy twilight. How
      came he here? Who is he? What does he tremble at? In this duskiness we
      cannot tell. Only that he is a young man, in a state of nervous excitement
      and alarm, looking about him, starting to his feet, sometimes standing and
      staring about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has he been living here? Apparently not; for see, he has a pair of long
      riding-boots on, coming up to the knees; they are splashed with mud, as if
      he had ridden hastily through foul ways; the spurs are on the heel. A
      riding-dress upon him. Ha! is that blood upon the hand which he clasps to
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      What more do you perceive? Nothing, the light is so dim; but only we
      wonder where is the door, and whence the light comes. There is a strange
      abundance of spiders, too, we perceive; spinning their webs here, as if
      they would entrammel something in them. A mouse has run across the floor,
      apparently, but it is too dim to detect him, or to detect anything beyond
      the limits of a very doubtful vagueness. We do not even know whether what
      we seem to have seen is really so; whether the man is young, or old, or
      what his surroundings are; and there is something so disagreeable in this
      seclusion, this stifled atmosphere, that we should be loath to remain here
      long enough to make ourselves certain of what was a mystery. Let us forth
      into the broad, genial daylight, for there is magic, there is a devilish,
      subtile influence, in this chamber; which, I have reason to believe, makes
      it dangerous to remain here. There is a spell on the threshold. Heaven
      keep us safe from it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hark! has a door unclosed? Is there another human being in the room? We
      have now become so accustomed to the dim medium that we distinguish a man
      of mean exterior, with a look of habitual subservience that seems like
      that of an English serving-man, or a person in some menial situation;
      decent, quiet, neat, softly-behaved, but yet with a certain hard and
      questionable presence, which we would not well like to have near us in the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I safe?&rdquo; asks the inmate of the prison-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, there has been a search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the pistols,&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, [Endnote: 2] after this time, a long time extending to years, let
      us look back into that dim chamber, wherever in the world it was, into
      which we had a glimpse, and where we saw apparently a fugitive. How looks
      it now? Still dim,&mdash;perhaps as dim as ever,&mdash;but our eyes, or
      our imagination, have gained an acquaintance, a customariness, with the
      medium; so that we can discern things now a little more distinctly than of
      old. Possibly, there may have been something cleared away that obstructed
      the light; at any rate, we see now the whereabouts&mdash;better than we
      did. It is an oblong room, lofty but narrow, and some ten paces in length;
      its floor is heavily carpeted, so that the tread makes no sound; it is
      hung with old tapestry, or carpet, wrought with the hand long ago, and
      still retaining much of the ancient colors, where there was no sunshine to
      fade them; worked on them is some tapestried story, done by Catholic
      hands, of saints or devils, looking each equally grave and solemnly. The
      light, whence comes it? There is no window; but it seems to come through a
      stone, or something like it,&mdash;a dull gray medium, that makes noonday
      look like evening twilight. Though sometimes there is an effect as if
      something were striving to melt itself through this dull medium, and&mdash;never
      making a shadow&mdash;yet to produce the effect of a cloud gathering
      thickly over the sun. There is a chimney; yes, a little grate in which
      burns a coal fire, a dim smouldering fire, it might be an illumination, if
      that were desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the furniture? An antique chair,&mdash;one chair, no more. A
      table, many-footed, of dark wood; it holds writing-materials, a book, too,
      on its face, with the dust gathered on its back. There is, moreover, a
      sort of antique box, or coffer, of some dark wood, that seems to have been
      wrought or carved with skill, wondrous skill, of some period when the art
      of carving wainscot with arms and devices was much practised; so that on
      this coffer&mdash;some six feet long it is, and two or three broad&mdash;most
      richly wrought, you see faces in relief of knight and dame, lords,
      heraldic animals; some story, very likely, told, almost revelling in
      Gothic sculpture of wood, like what we have seen on the marble sarcophagus
      of the old Greeks. It has, too, a lock, elaborately ornamented and inlaid
      with silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      What else; only the spider&rsquo;s webs spinning strangely over everything; over
      that light which comes into the room through the stone; over everything.
      And now we see, in a corner, a strange great spider curiously variegated.
      The ugly, terrible, seemingly poisonous thing makes us shudder. [Endnote:
      3.]
    </p>
    <p>
      What, else? There are pistols; they lie on the coffer! There is a
      curiously shaped Italian dagger, of the kind which in a groove has poison
      that makes its wound mortal. On the old mantel-piece, over the fireplace,
      there is a vial in which are kept certain poisons. It would seem as if
      some one had meditated suicide; or else that the foul fiend had put all
      sorts of implements of self-destruction in his way; so that, in some
      frenzied moment, he might kill himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the inmate! There he is; but the frenzied alarm in which we last saw
      him seems to have changed its character. No throb, now; no passion; no
      frenzy of fear or despair. He sits dull and motionless. See; his cheek is
      very pale; his hair long and dishevelled. His beard has grown, and curls
      round his face. He has on a sleeping-gown, a long robe as of one who
      abides within doors, and has nothing to do with outward elements; a pair
      of slippers. A dull, dreamy reverie seems to have possessed him. Hark!
      there is again a stealthy step on the floor, and the serving-man is here
      again. There is a peering, anxious curiosity in his face, as he struts
      towards him, a sort of enjoyment, one would say, in the way in which he
      looks at the strange case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, you know,&rdquo; he says, at length, after feasting his eyes for
      some time on the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you!&rdquo; says the young man, in a dull, indifferent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not your honor walk out to-day?&rdquo; says the man. &ldquo;It is long now since
      your honor has taken the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very long,&rdquo; says the master, &ldquo;but I will not go out to-day. What weather
      is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunny, bright, a summer day,&rdquo; says the man. &ldquo;But you would never know it
      in these damp walls. The last winter&rsquo;s chill is here yet. Had not your
      honor better go forth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might seem that there was a sort of sneer, deeply hidden under respect
      and obeisance, in the man&rsquo;s words and craftily respectful tone; deeply
      hidden, but conveying a more subtile power on that account. At all events,
      the master seemed aroused from his state of dull indifference, and writhed
      as with poignant anguish&mdash;an infused poison in his veins&mdash;as the
      man spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you procured me that new drug I spoke of?&rdquo; asked the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said the man, putting a small package on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it effectual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So said the apothecary,&rdquo; answered the man; &ldquo;and I tried it on a dog. He
      sat quietly a quarter of an hour; then had a spasm or two, and was dead.
      But, your honor, the dead carcass swelled horribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, villain! Have there&mdash;have there been inquiries for me,&mdash;mention
      of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, none, sir,&mdash;none, sir. Affairs go on bravely,&mdash;the new live.
      The world fills up. The gap is not vacant. There is no mention of you.
      Marry, at the alehouse I heard some idle topers talking of a murder that
      took place some few years since, and saying that Heaven&rsquo;s vengeance would
      come for it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, villain, there is no such thing,&rdquo; said the young man; and, with
      a laugh that seemed like scorn, he relapsed into his state of sullen
      indifference; during which the servant stole away, after looking at him
      some time, as if to take all possible note of his aspect. The man did not
      seem so much to enjoy it himself, as he did to do these things in a kind
      of formal and matter-of-course way, as if he were performing a set duty;
      as if he were a subordinate fiend, and were doing the duty of a superior
      one, without any individual malice of his own, though a general
      satisfaction in doing what would accrue to the agglomeration of deadly
      mischief. He stole away, and the master was left to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, by what impulse or cause it is impossible to say, he started
      upon his feet in a sudden frenzy of rage and despair. It seemed as if a
      consciousness of some strange, wild miserable fate that had befallen him
      had come upon him all at once; how that he was a prisoner to a devilish
      influence, to some wizard might, that bound him hand and foot with
      spider&rsquo;s web. So he stamped; so he half shrieked, yet stopped himself in
      the midst, so that his cry was stifled and smothered. Then he snatched up
      the poisoned dagger and looked at it; the noose, and put it about his
      neck,&mdash;evil instrument of death,&mdash;but laid it down again. And
      then was a voice at the door: &ldquo;Quietly, quietly you know, or they will
      hear you.&rdquo; And at that voice he sank into sullen indifference again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A traveller with a knapsack on his shoulders comes out of the duskiness of
      vague, unchronicled times, throwing his shadow before him in the morning
      sunshine along a well-trodden, though solitary path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early summer, or perhaps latter spring, and the most genial weather
      that either spring or summer ever brought, possessing a character, indeed,
      as if both seasons had done their utmost to create an atmosphere and
      temperature most suitable for the enjoyment and exercise of life. To one
      accustomed to a climate where there is seldom a medium between heat too
      fierce and cold too deadly, it was a new development in the nature of
      weather. So genial it was, so full of all comfortable influences, and yet,
      somehow or other, void of the torrid characteristic that inevitably burns
      in our full sun-bursts. The traveller thought, in fact, that the sun was
      at less than his brightest glow; for though it was bright,&mdash;though
      the day seemed cloudless,&mdash;though it appeared to be the clear,
      transparent morning that precedes an unshadowed noon,&mdash;still there
      was a mild and softened character, not so perceptible when he directly
      sought to see it, but as if some veil were interposed between the earth
      and sun, absorbing all the passionate qualities out of the latter, and
      leaving only the kindly ones. Warmth was in abundance, and, yet, all
      through it, and strangely akin to it, there was a half-suspected coolness
      that gave the atmosphere its most thrilling and delicious charm. It was
      good for human life, as the traveller, felt throughout all his being;
      good, likewise, for vegetable life, as was seen in the depth and richness
      of verdure over the gently undulating landscape, and the luxuriance of
      foliage, wherever there was tree or shrub to put forth leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path along which the traveller was passing deserved at least a word or
      two of description: it was a well-trodden footpath, running just here
      along the edge of a field of grass, and bordered on one side by a hedge
      which contained materials within itself for varied and minute researches
      in natural history; so richly luxuriant was it with its diverse vegetable
      life, such a green intricacy did it form, so impenetrable and so
      beautiful, and such a Paradise it was for the birds that built their nests
      there in a labyrinth of little boughs and twigs, unseen and inaccessible,
      while close beside the human race to which they attach themselves, that
      they must have felt themselves as safe as when they sung to Eve. Homely
      flowers likewise grew in it, and many creeping and twining plants, that
      were an original part of the hedge, had come of their own accord and dwelt
      here, beautifying and enriching the verdant fence by way of repayment for
      the shelter and support which it afforded them. At intervals, trees of
      vast trunk and mighty spread of foliage, whether elms or oaks, grew in the
      line of the hedge, and the bark of those gigantic, age-long patriarchs was
      not gray and naked, like the trees which the traveller had been accustomed
      to see, but verdant with moss, or in many cases richly enwreathed with a
      network of creeping plants, and oftenest the ivy of old growth, clambering
      upward, and making its own twisted stem almost of one substance with the
      supporting tree. On one venerable oak there was a plant of mystic leaf,
      which the traveller knew by instinct, and plucked a bough of it with a
      certain reverence for the sake of the Druids and Christmas kisses and of
      the pasty in which it was rooted from of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path in which he walked, rustic as it was and made merely by the feet
      that pressed it down, was one of the ancientest of ways; older than the
      oak that bore the mistletoe, older than the villages between which it
      passed, older perhaps than the common road which the traveller had crossed
      that morning; old as the times when people first debarred themselves from
      wandering freely and widely wherever a vagrant impulse led them. The
      footpath, therefore, still retains some of the characteristics of a
      woodland walk, taken at random, by a lover of nature not pressed for time
      nor restrained by artificial barriers; it sweeps and lingers along, and
      finds pretty little dells and nooks of delightful scenery, and picturesque
      glimpses of halls or cottages, in the same neighborhood where a highroad
      would disclose only a tiresome blank. They run into one another for miles
      and miles together, and traverse rigidly guarded parks and domains, not as
      a matter of favor, but as a right; so that the poorest man thus retains a
      kind of property and privilege in the oldest inheritance of the richest.
      The highroad sees only the outside; the footpath leads down into the heart
      of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant feature of the footpath was the stile, between two fields; no
      frail and temporary structure, but betokening the permanence of this
      rustic way; the ancient solidity of the stone steps, worn into cavities by
      the hobnailed shoes that had pressed upon them: here not only the climbing
      foot had passed for ages, but here had sat the maiden with her milk-pail,
      the rustic on his way afield or homeward; here had been lover meetings,
      cheerful chance chats, song as natural as bird note, a thousand pretty
      scenes of rustic manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious to see the traveller pause, to contemplate so simple a
      thing as this old stile of a few stone steps; antique as an old castle;
      simple and rustic as the gap in a rail fence; and while he sat on one of
      the steps, making himself pleasantly sensible of his whereabout, like one
      who should handle a dream and find it tangible and real, he heard a sound
      that bewitched him with still another dreamy delight. A bird rose out of
      the grassy field, and, still soaring aloft, made a cheery melody that was
      like a spire of audible flame,&mdash;rapturous music, as if the whole soul
      and substance of the winged creature had been distilled into this melody,
      as it vanished skyward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lark! the lark!&rdquo; exclaimed the traveller, recognizing the note
      (though never heard before) as if his childhood had known it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards another bird was heard in the shadow of a neighboring
      wood, or some other inscrutable hiding-place, singing softly in a
      flute-like note, as if blown through an instrument of wood,&mdash;&ldquo;Cuckoo!
      Cuckoo!&rdquo;&mdash;only twice, and then a stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How familiar these rustic sounds!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Surely I was born
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person who thus enjoyed these sounds, as if they were at once familiar
      and strange, was a young man, tall and rather slenderly built, and though
      we have called him young, there were the traces of thought, struggle, and
      even of experience in his marked brow and somewhat pale face; but the
      spirit within him was evidently still that of a youth, lithe and active,
      gazing out of his dark eyes and taking note of things about him, with an
      eager, centring interest, that seemed to be unusually awake at the present
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could be but a few years since he first called himself a man; but they
      must have been thickly studded with events, turbulent with action, spent
      amidst circumstances that called for resources of energy not often so
      early developed; and thus his youth might have been kept in abeyance until
      now, when in this simple rural scene he grew almost a boy again. As for
      his station in life, his coarse gray suit and the knapsack on his
      shoulders did not indicate a very high one; yet it was such as a gentleman
      might wear of a morning, or on a pedestrian ramble, and was worn in a way
      that made it seem of a better fashion than it really was, as it enabled
      him to find a rare enjoyment, as we have seen, in by-path, hedge-row,
      rustic stile, lark, and cuckoo, and even the familiar grass and clover
      blossom. It was as if he had long been shut in a sick-chamber or a prison;
      or, at least, within the iron cage of busy life, that had given him but
      few glimpses of natural things through its bars; or else this was another
      kind of nature than he had heretofore known.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked along (through a kind of dream, though he seemed so sensibly
      observant of trifling things around him,) he failed to notice that the
      path grew somewhat less distinctly marked, more infringed upon by grass,
      more shut in by shrubbery; he had deviated into a side track, and, in
      fact, a certain printed board nailed against a tree had escaped his
      notice, warning off intruders with inhospitable threats of prosecution. He
      began to suspect that he must have gone astray when the path led over
      plashy ground with a still fainter trail of preceding footsteps, and
      plunged into shrubbery, and seemed on the point of deserting him
      altogether, after having beguiled him thus far. The spot was an
      entanglement of boughs, and yet did not give one the impression of
      wildness; for it was the stranger&rsquo;s idea that everything in this long
      cultivated region had been touched and influenced by man&rsquo;s care, every
      oak, every bush, every sod,&mdash;that man knew them all, and that they
      knew him, and by that mutual knowledge had become far other than they were
      in the first freedom of growth, such as may be found in an American
      forest. Nay, the wildest denizens of this sylvan neighborhood were removed
      in the same degree from their primeval character; for hares sat on their
      hind legs to gaze at the approaching traveller, and hardly thought it
      worth their while to leap away among some ferns, as he drew near; two
      pheasants looked at him from a bough, a little inward among the shrubbery;
      and, to complete the wonder, he became aware of the antlers and brown
      muzzle of a deer protruding among the boughs, and though immediately there
      ensued a great rush and rustling of the herd, it seemed evidently to come
      from a certain lingering shyness, an instinct that had lost its purpose
      and object, and only mimicked a dread of man, whose neighborhood and
      familiarity had tamed the wild deer almost into a domestic creature.
      Remembering his experience of true woodland life, the traveller fancied
      that it might be possible to want freer air, less often used for human
      breath, than was to be found anywhere among these woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then the sweet, calm sense of safety that was here: the certainty that
      with the wild element that centuries ago had passed out of this scene had
      gone all the perils of wild men and savage beasts, dwarfs, witches,
      leaving nature, not effete, but only disarmed of those rougher, deadlier
      characteristics, that cruel rawness, which make primeval Nature the deadly
      enemy even of her own children. Here was consolation, doubtless; so we sit
      down on the stone step of the last stile that he had crossed, and listen
      to the footsteps of the traveller, and the distant rustle among the
      shrubbery, as he goes deeper and deeper into the seclusion, having by this
      time lost the deceitful track. No matter if he go astray; even were it
      after nightfall instead of noontime, a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, or Puck himself,
      would not lead him into worse harm than to delude him into some mossy
      pool, the depths of which the truant schoolboys had known for ages.
      Nevertheless, some little time after his disappearance, there was the
      report of a shot that echoed sharp and loud, startling the pheasants from
      their boughs, and sending the hares and deer a-scampering in good earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We next find our friend, from whom we parted on the footpath, in a
      situation of which he then was but very imperfectly aware; for, indeed, he
      had been in a state of unconsciousness, lasting until it was now late
      towards the sunset of that same day. He was endeavoring to make out where
      he was, and how he came thither, or what had happened; or whether, indeed,
      anything had happened, unless to have fallen asleep, and to be still
      enveloped in the fragments of some vivid and almost tangible dream, the
      more confused because so vivid. His wits did not come so readily about him
      as usual; there may have been a slight delusion, which mingled itself with
      his sober perceptions, and by its leaven of extravagance made the whole
      substance of the scene untrue. Thus it happened that, as it were at the
      same instant, he fancied himself years back in life, thousands of miles
      away, in a gloomy cobwebbed room, looking out upon a graveyard, while yet,
      neither more nor less distinctly, he was conscious of being in a small
      chamber, panelled with oak, and furnished in an antique style. He was
      doubtful, too, whether or no there was a grim feudal figure, in a shabby
      dressing-gown and an old velvet cap, sitting in the dusk of the room,
      smoking a pipe that diffused a scent of tobacco,&mdash;quaffing a
      deep-hued liquor out of a tumbler,&mdash;looking upwards at a spider that
      hung above. &ldquo;Was there, too, a child sitting in a little chair at his
      footstool?&rdquo; In his earnestness to see this apparition more distinctly, he
      opened his eyes wider and stirred, and ceased to see it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though that other dusty, squalid, cobwebbed scene quite vanished, and
      along with it the two figures, old and young, grim and childish, of whose
      portraits it had been the framework, still there were features in the old,
      oaken-panelled chamber that seemed to belong rather to his dream. The
      panels were ornamented, here and there, with antique carving, representing
      over and over again an identical device, being a bare arm, holding the
      torn-off head of some savage beast, which the stranger could not know by
      species, any more than Agassiz himself could have assigned its type or
      kindred; because it was that kind of natural history of which heraldry
      alone keeps the menagerie. But it was just as familiar to his recollection
      as that of the cat which he had fondled in his childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was likewise a mantelpiece, heavily wrought of oak, quite black with
      smoke and age, in the centre of which, more prominent than elsewhere, was
      that same leopard&rsquo;s head that seemed to thrust itself everywhere into
      sight, as if typifying some great mystery which human nature would never
      be at rest till it had solved; and below, in a cavernous hollow, there was
      a smouldering fire of coals; for the genial day had suddenly grown chill,
      and a shower of rain spattered against the small window-panes, almost at
      the same time with the struggling sunshine. And over the mantelpiece,
      where the light of the declining day came strongest from the window, there
      was a larger and more highly relieved carving of this same device, and
      underneath it a legend, in Old English letters, which, though his eyes
      could not precisely trace it at that distance, he knew to be this:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;Hold hard the Head.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Otherwise the aspect of the room bewildered him by not being known, since
      these details were so familiar; a narrow precinct it was, with one window
      full of old-fashioned, diamond-shaped panes of glass, a small desk table,
      standing on clawed feet; two or three high-backed chairs, on the top of
      each of which was carved that same crest of the fabulous brute&rsquo;s head,
      which the carver&rsquo;s fancy seemed to have clutched so strongly that he could
      not let it go; in another part of the room a very old engraving, rude and
      strong, representing some ruffled personage, which the stranger only tried
      to make out with a sort of idle curiosity, because it was strange he
      should dream so distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon it became intolerably irritating that these two dreams, both
      purposeless, should have mingled and entangled themselves in his mind. He
      made a nervous and petulant motion, intending to rouse himself fully; and
      immediately a sharp pang of physical pain took him by surprise, and made
      him groan aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately there was an almost noiseless step on the floor; and a figure
      emerged from a deep niche, that looked as if it might once have been an
      oratory, in ancient times; and the figure, too, might have been supposed
      to possess the devout and sanctified character of such as knelt in the
      oratories of ancient times. It was an elderly man, tall, thin, and pale,
      and wearing a long, dark tunic, and in a peculiar fashion, which&mdash;like
      almost everything else about him&mdash;the stranger seemed to have a
      confused remembrance of; this venerable person had a benign and pitiful
      aspect, and approached the bedside with such good will and evident desire
      to do the sufferer good, that the latter felt soothed, at least, by his
      very presence. He lay, a moment, gazing up at the old man&rsquo;s face, without
      being able to exert himself to say a word, but sensible, as it were, of a
      mild, soft influence from him, cooling the fever which seemed to burn in
      his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suffer much pain?&rdquo; asked the old man, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; said the stranger; but again a slight motion caused him to
      feel a burning twinge in his shoulder. &ldquo;Yes; there was a throb of strange
      anguish. Why should I feel pain? Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In safety, and with those who desire to be your friends,&rdquo; said the old
      man. &ldquo;You have met with an accident; but do not inquire about it now.
      Quiet is what you need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the traveller gazed at him; and the old man&rsquo;s figure seemed to enter
      into his dream, or delirium, whichever it might be, as if his peaceful
      presence were but a shadow, so quaint was his address, so unlike real
      life, in that dark robe, with a velvet skullcap on his head, beneath which
      his hair made a silvery border; and looking more closely, the stranger saw
      embroidered on the breast of the tunic that same device, the arm and the
      leopard&rsquo;s head, which was visible in the carving of the room. Yes; this
      must still be a dream, which, under the unknown laws which govern such
      psychical states, had brought out thus vividly figures, devices, words,
      forgotten since his boyish days. Though of an imaginative tendency, the
      stranger was nevertheless strongly tenacious of the actual, and had a
      natural horror at the idea of being seriously at odds, in beliefs,
      perceptions, conclusions, with the real world about him; so that a tremor
      ran through him, as if he felt the substance of the world shimmering
      before his eyes like a mere vaporous consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you real?&rdquo; said he to the antique presence; &ldquo;or a spirit? or a
      fantasy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man laid his thin, cool palm on the stranger&rsquo;s burning forehead,
      and smiled benignantly, keeping it there an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If flesh and blood are real, I am so,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;a spirit, too, I may
      claim to be, made thin by fantasy. Again, do not perplex yourself with
      such things. To-morrow you may find denser substance in me. Drink this
      composing draught, and close your eyes to those things that disturb you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your features, too, and your voice,&rdquo; said the stranger, in a resigned
      tone, as if he were giving up a riddle, the solution of which he could not
      find, &ldquo;have an image and echo somewhere in my memory. It is all an
      entanglement. I will drink, and shut my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank from a little old-fashioned silver cup, which his venerable
      guardian presented to his lips; but in so doing he was still perplexed and
      tremulously disturbed with seeing that same weary old device, the
      leopard&rsquo;s head, engraved on the side; and shut his eyes to escape it, for
      it irritated a certain portion of his brain with vague, fanciful, elusive
      ideas. So he sighed and spoke no more. The medicine, whatever it might be,
      had the merit, rare in doctor&rsquo;s stuff, of being pleasant to take,
      assuasive of thirst, and imbued with a hardly perceptible fragrance, that
      was so ethereal that it also seemed to enter into his dream and modify it.
      He kept his eyes closed, and fell into a misty state, in which he wondered
      whether this could be the panacea or medicament which old Doctor Grimshawe
      used to distil from cobwebs, and of which the fragrance seemed to breathe
      through all the waste of years since then. He wondered, too, who was this
      benign, saint-like old man, and where, in what former state of being, he
      could have known him; to have him thus, as no strange thing, and yet so
      strange, be attending at his bedside, with all this ancient garniture. But
      it was best to dismiss all things, he being so weak; to resign himself;
      all this had happened before, and had passed away, prosperously or
      unprosperously; it would pass away in this case, likewise; and in the
      morning whatever might be delusive would have disappeared.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The patient [Endnote: 1] had a favorable night, and awoke with a much
      clearer head, though still considerably feverish and in a state of great
      exhaustion from loss of blood, which kept down the fever. The events of
      the preceding day shimmered as it were and shifted illusively in his
      recollection; nor could he yet account for the situation in which he found
      himself, the antique chamber, the old man of mediæval garb, nor even for
      the wound which seemed to have been the occasion of bringing him thither.
      One moment, so far as he remembered, he had been straying along a solitary
      footpath, through rich shrubbery, with the antlered deer peeping at him,
      listening to the lark and the cuckoo; the next, he lay helpless in this
      oak-panelled chamber, surrounded with objects that appealed to some
      fantastic shadow of recollection, which could have had no reality.

      To say the truth, the traveller perhaps wilfully kept hold of this strange
      illusiveness, and kept his thoughts from too harshly analyzing his
      situation, and solving the riddle in which he found himself involved. In
      his present weakness, his mind sympathizing with the sinking down of his
      physical powers, it was delightful to let all go; to relinquish all
      control, and let himself drift vaguely into whatever region of
      improbabilities there exists apart from the dull, common plane of life.
      Weak, stricken down, given over to influences which had taken possession
      of him during an interval of insensibility, he was no longer responsible;
      let these delusions, if they were such, linger as long as they would, and
      depart of their own accord at last. He, meanwhile, would willingly accept
      the idea that some spell had transported him out of an epoch in which he
      had led a brief, troubled existence of battle, mental strife, success,
      failure, all equally feverish and unsatisfactory, into some past century,
      where the business was to rest,&mdash;to drag on dreamy days, looking at
      things through half-shut eyes; into a limbo where things were put away,
      shows of what had once been, now somehow fainted, and still maintaining a
      sort of half-existence, a serious mockery; a state likely enough to exist
      just a little apart from the actual world, if we only know how to find our
      way into it. Scenes and events that had once stained themselves, in deep
      colors, on the curtain that Time hangs around us, to shut us in from
      eternity, cannot be quite effaced by the succeeding phantasmagoria, and
      sometimes, by a palimpsest, show more strongly than they. [Endnote: 3.]

      In the course of the morning, however, he was a little too feelingly made
      sensible of realities by the visit of a surgeon, who proceeded to examine
      the wound in his shoulder, removing the bandages which he himself seemed
      to have put upon this mysterious hurt. The traveller closed his eyes, and
      submitted to the manipulations of the professional person, painful as they
      were, assisted by the gentle touch of the old palmer; and there was
      something in the way in which he resigned himself that met the approbation
      of the surgeon, in spite of a little fever, and slight delirium too, to
      judge by his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very quiet and well-behaved patient,&rdquo; said he to the palmer. &ldquo;Unless I
      greatly mistake, he has been under the surgeon&rsquo;s hand for a similar hurt
      ere now. He has learned under good discipline how to take such a thing
      easily. Yes, yes; just here is a mark where a bullet went in some time
      ago,&mdash;three or four years since, when he could have been little more
      than a boy. A wild fellow this, I doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an Indian bullet,&rdquo; said the patient, still fancying himself gone
      astray into the past, &ldquo;shot at me in battle; &lsquo;twas three hundred years
      hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he has served in the East Indies,&rdquo; said the surgeon. &ldquo;I thought this
      sun-burned cheek had taken its hue elsewhere than in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient did not care to take the trouble which would have been
      involved in correcting the surgeon&rsquo;s surmise; so he let it pass, and
      patiently awaited the end of the examination, with only a moan or two,
      which seemed rather pleasing and desirable than otherwise to the surgeon&rsquo;s
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has vitality enough for his needs,&rdquo; said he, nodding to the palmer.
      &ldquo;These groans betoken a good degree of pain; though the young fellow is
      evidently a self-contained sort of nature, and does not let us know all he
      feels. It promises well, however; keep him in bed and quiet, and within a
      day or two we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote a recipe, or two or three, perhaps, (for in those days the
      medical fraternity had faith in their own art,) and took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white-bearded palmer withdrew into the half concealment of the oratory
      which we have already mentioned, and then, putting on a pair of
      spectacles, betook himself to the perusal of an old folio volume, the
      leaves of which he turned over so gently that not the slightest sound
      could possibly disturb the patient. All his manifestations were gentle and
      soft, but of a simplicity most unlike the feline softness which we are apt
      to associate with a noiseless tread and movement in the male sex. The
      sunshine came through the ivy and glimmered upon his great book, however,
      with an effect which a little disturbed the patient&rsquo;s nerves; besides, he
      desired to have a fuller view of his benign guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit nearer the bedside?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wish to look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Weakness, the relaxation of nerves, and the state of dependence on
      another&rsquo;s care&mdash;very long unfelt&mdash;had made him betray what we
      must call childishness; and it was perceptible in the low half-complaining
      tone in which he spoke, indicating a consciousness of kindness in the
      other, a little plaintiveness in himself; of which, the next instant, weak
      and wandering as he was, he was ashamed, and essayed to express it.
      [Endnote: 4.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must deem me very poor-spirited,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not to bear this trifling
      hurt with a firmer mind. But perhaps it is not entirely that I am so weak,
      but I feel you to be so benign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be weak, and be the stronger for it,&rdquo; said the old man, with a grave
      smile. &ldquo;It is not in the pride of our strength that we are best or wisest.
      To be made anew, we even must be again a little child, and consent to be
      enwrapt quietly in the arms of Providence, as a child in its mother&rsquo;s
      arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew a mother&rsquo;s care,&rdquo; replied the traveller, in a low, regretful
      tone, being weak to the incoming of all soft feelings, in his present
      state. &ldquo;Since my boyhood, I have lived among men,&mdash;a life of struggle
      and hard rivalry. It is good to find myself here in the long past, and in
      a sheltered harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here he smiled, by way of showing to this old palmer that he saw
      through the slight infirmity of mind that impelled him to say such things
      as the above; that he was not its dupe, though he had not strength, just
      now, to resist its impulse. After this he dozed off softly, and felt
      through all his sleep some twinges of his wound, bringing him back, as it
      were, to the conscious surface of the great deep of slumber, into which he
      might otherwise have sunk. At all such brief intervals, half unclosing his
      eyes, (like a child, when the mother sits by its bed and he fears that she
      will steal away if he falls quite asleep, and leave him in the dark
      solitude,) he still beheld the white-bearded, kindly old man, of saintly
      aspect, sitting near him, and turning over the pages of his folio volume
      so softly that not the faintest rustle did it make; the picture at length
      got so fully into his idea, that he seemed to see it even through his
      closed eyelids. After a while, however, the slumberous tendency left him
      more entirely, and, without having been consciously awake, he found
      himself contemplating the old man, with wide-open eyes. The venerable
      personage seemed soon to feel his gaze, and, ceasing to look at the folio,
      he turned his eyes with quiet inquiry to meet those of the stranger.
      [Endnote: 5.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What great volume is that?&rdquo; asked the latter. [Endnote: 6.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a book of English chronicles,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;mostly relating
      to the part of the island where you now are, and to times previous to the
      Stuarts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is to you, a contemporary, what reading the newspaper is to other
      men,&rdquo; said the stranger; then, with a smile of self-reproach, &ldquo;I shall
      conquer this idle mood. I&rsquo;m not so imbecile as you must think me. But
      there is something that strangely haunts me,&mdash;where, in what state of
      being, can I have seen your face before. There is nothing in it I
      distinctly remember; but some impression, some characteristic, some look,
      with which I have been long ago familiar haunts me and brings back all old
      scenes. Do you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled. &ldquo;I knew, long ago, a bright and impressible boy,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name?&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Edward Redclyffe,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see who you are,&rdquo; said the traveller, not too earnestly, but with a
      soft, gratified feeling, as the riddle thus far solved itself. &ldquo;You are my
      old kindly instructor. You are Colcord! That is it. I remember you
      disappeared. You shall tell me, when I am quite myself, what was that
      mystery,&mdash;and whether it is your real self, or only a part of my
      dream, and going to vanish when I quite awake. Now I shall sleep and dream
      more of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One more waking interval he had that day, and again essayed to enter into
      conversation with the old man, who had thus strangely again become
      connected with his life, after having so long vanished from his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; asked Edward Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the home of misfortune,&rdquo; said Colcord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then I have a right to be here!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was born in such a home.
      Do you remember it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your story,&rdquo; said Colcord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; from Doctor Grim,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;People whispered he had made away
      with you. I never believed it; but finding you here in this strange way,
      and myself having been shot, perhaps to death, it seems not so strange.
      Pooh! I wander again, and ought to sleep a little more. And this is the
      home of misfortune, but not like the squalid place of rage, idiocy,
      imbecility, drunkenness, where I was born. How many times I have blushed
      to remember that native home! But not of late! I have struggled; I have
      fought; I have triumphed. The unknown boy has come to be no
      undistinguished man! His ancestry, should he ever reveal himself to them,
      need not blush for the poor foundling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the quiet watcher. &ldquo;Your fever burns you. Take this draught,
      and sleep a little longer.&rdquo; [Endnote: 7.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day or two found Edward Redclyffe almost a convalescent. The
      singular lack of impatience that characterized his present mood&mdash;the
      repose of spirit into which he had lapsed&mdash;had much to do with the
      favorable progress of his cure. After strife, anxiety, great mental
      exertion, and excitement of various kinds, which had harassed him ever
      since he grew to be a man, had come this opportunity of perfect rest;&mdash;this
      dream in the midst of which he lay, while its magic boundaries involved
      him, and kept far off the contact of actual life, so that its sounds and
      tumults seemed remote; its cares could not fret him; its ambitions,
      objects good or evil, were shut out from him; the electric wires that had
      connected him with the battery of life were broken for the time, and he
      did not feel the unquiet influence that kept everybody else in galvanic
      motion. So, under the benign influence of the old palmer, he lay in
      slumberous luxury, undisturbed save by some twinges of no intolerable
      pain; which, however, he almost was glad of, because it made him sensible
      that this deep luxury of quiet was essential to his cure, however idle it
      might seem. For the first time since he was a child, he resigned himself
      not to put a finger to the evolution of his fortune; he determined to
      accept all things that might happen, good or evil; he would not imagine an
      event beyond to-day, but would let one spontaneous and half-defined
      thought loiter after another, through his mind; listen to the spattering
      shower,&mdash;the puffs of shut-out wind; and look with half-shut eyes at
      the sunshine glimmering through the ivy-twigs, and illuminating those old
      devices on the wall; at the gathering twilight; at the dim lamp; at the
      creeping upward of another day, and with it the lark singing so far away
      that the thrill of its delicious song could not disturb him with an
      impulse to awake. Sweet as its carol was, he could almost have been
      content to miss the lark; sweet and clear, it was too like a fairy
      trumpet-call, summoning him to awake and struggle again with eager
      combatants for new victories, the best of which were not worth this deep
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old palmer did his best to prolong a mood so beneficial to the wounded
      young man. The surgeon also nodded approval, and attributed this happy
      state of the patient&rsquo;s mind, and all the physical advantages growing out
      of it, to his own consummate skill; nor, indeed, was he undeserving of
      credit, not often to be awarded to medical men, for having done nothing to
      impede the good which kind Nature was willing to bring about. She was
      doing the patient more good, indeed, than either the surgeon or the palmer
      could fully estimate, in taking this opportunity to recreate a mind that
      had too early known stirring impulse, and that had been worked to a degree
      beyond what its organization (in some respects singularly delicate) ought
      to have borne. Once in a long while the weary actors in the headlong drama
      of life must have such repose or else go mad or die. When the machinery of
      human life has once been stopped by sickness or other impediment, it often
      needs an impulse to set it going again, even after it is nearly wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it could not last forever. The influx of new life into his being began
      to have a poignancy that would not let him lie so quietly, lapped in the
      past, in gone by centuries, and waited on by quiet Age, in the person of
      the old palmer; he began to feel again that he was young, and must live in
      the time when his lot was cast. He began to say to himself, that it was
      not well to be any longer passive, but that he must again take the
      troublesome burden of his own life on his own shoulders. He thought of
      this necessity, this duty, throughout one whole day, and determined that
      on the morrow he would make the first step towards terminating his
      inaction, which he now began to be half impatient of, at the same time
      that he clutched it still, for the sake of the deliciousness that it had
      had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, I hope to be clothed and in my right mind,&rdquo; said he to the old
      palmer, &ldquo;and very soon I must thank you, with my whole heart, for your
      kind care, and go. It is a shame that I burden the hospitality of this
      house so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No shame whatever,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;but, on the contrary, the
      fittest thing that could have chanced. You are dependent on no private
      benevolence, nor on the good offices of any man now living, or who has
      lived these last three hundred years. This ancient establishment is for
      the support of poverty, misfortune, and age, and, according to the word of
      the founder, it serves him:&mdash;he was indebted to the beneficiaries,
      not they to him, for, in return for his temporal bequests, he asked their
      prayers for his soul&rsquo;s welfare. He needed them, could they avail him; for
      this ponderous structure was built upon the founder&rsquo;s mortal
      transgressions, and even, I may say, out of the actual substance of them.
      Sir Edward Redclyffe was a fierce fighter in the Wars of the Roses, and
      amassed much wealth by spoil, rapine, confiscation, and all violent and
      evil ways that those disturbed times opened to him; and on his death-bed
      he founded this Hospital for twelve men, who should be able to prove
      kindred with his race, to dwell here with a stipend, and pray for him; and
      likewise provision for a sick stranger, until he should be able to go on
      his way again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall pray for him willingly,&rdquo; said Edward, moved by the pity which
      awaits any softened state of our natures to steal into our hearts. &ldquo;Though
      no Catholic, I will pray for his soul. And that is his crest which you
      wear embroidered on his garment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;You will see it carved, painted, embroidered,
      everywhere about the establishment; but let us give it the better and more
      reasonable interpretation;&mdash;not that he sought to proclaim his own
      pride of ancestry and race, but to acknowledge his sins the more
      manifestly, by stamping the emblem of his race on this structure of his
      penitence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, impressed anew by the quiet dignity of the
      venerable speaker, &ldquo;in authority in the establishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A simple beneficiary of the charity,&rdquo; said the palmer; &ldquo;one of the twelve
      poor brethren and kinsmen of the founder. Slighter proofs of kindred are
      now of necessity received, since, in the natural course of things, the
      race has long been growing scarce. But I had it in my power to make out a
      sufficient claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular,&rdquo; exclaimed Redclyffe, &ldquo;you being an American!&rdquo; [Endnote: 8.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember me, then,&rdquo; said the old man, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the first,&rdquo; said Edward, &ldquo;although your image took the fantastic
      aspect of the bewilderment in which I then was; and now that I am in
      clearer state of mind, it seems yet stranger that you should be here. We
      two children thought you translated, and people, I remember, whispered
      dark hints about your fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing wonderful in my disappearance,&rdquo; said the old man.
      &ldquo;There were causes, an impulse, an intuition, that made me feel, one
      particular night, that I might meet harm, whether from myself or others,
      by remaining in a place with which I had the most casual connection. But I
      never, so long as I remained in America, quite lost sight of you; and
      Doctor Grimshawe, before his death, had knowledge of where I was, and gave
      me in charge a duty which I faithfully endeavored to perform. Singular man
      that he was! much evil, much good in him. Both, it may be, will live after
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe, when the conversation had reached this point, felt a vast
      desire to reveal to the old man all that the grim Doctor had instilled
      into his childish mind, all that he himself, in subsequent years, had
      wrought more definitely out of it, all his accompanying doubts respecting
      the secret of his birth and some supposed claims which he might assert,
      and which, only half acknowledging the purpose, had availed to bring him,
      a republican, hither as to an ancestral centre. He even fancied that the
      benign old man seemed to expect and await such a confidence; but that very
      idea contributed to make it impossible for him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Perhaps never. It is a fantastic
      folly; and with what the workhouse foundling has since achieved, he would
      give up too many hopes to take the representation of a mouldy old English
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find my head still very weak,&rdquo; said he, by way of cutting short the
      conversation. &ldquo;I must try to sleep again.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day he called for his clothes, and, with the assistance of the
      pensioner, managed to be dressed, and awaited the arrival of the surgeon,
      sitting in a great easy-chair, with not much except his pale, thin cheeks,
      dark, thoughtful eyes, and his arm in a sling, to show the pain and danger
      through which he had passed. Soon after the departure of the professional
      gentleman, a step somewhat louder than ordinary was heard on the
      staircase, and in the corridor leading to the sick-chamber; the step (as
      Redclyffe&rsquo;s perceptions, nicely attempered by his weakness, assured him)
      of a man in perfect and robust health, and of station and authority. A
      moment afterwards, a gentleman of middle age, or a little beyond, appeared
      in the doorway, in a dress that seemed clerical, yet not very decidedly
      so; he had a frank, kindly, yet authoritative bearing, and a face that
      might almost be said to beam with geniality, when, as now, the benevolence
      of his nature was aroused and ready to express itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Doctor Portingale tells me you are much better; and
      I am most happy to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something brusque and unceremonious in his manner, that a little
      jarred against Redclyffe&rsquo;s sensitiveness, which had become morbid in
      sympathy with his weakness. He felt that the new-comer had not probably
      the right idea as to his own position in life; he was addressing him most
      kindly, indeed, but as an inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much better, sir,&rdquo; he replied, gravely, and with reserve; &ldquo;so nearly
      well, that I shall very soon be able to bid farewell to my kind nurse
      here, and to this ancient establishment, to which I owe so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor seemed struck by Mr. Redclyffe&rsquo;s tone, and finely modulated
      voice, and glanced at his face, and then over his dress and figure, as if
      to gather from them some reliable data as to his station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the Warden of this Hospital,&rdquo; said he, with not less benignity than
      heretofore, and greater courtesy; &ldquo;and, in that capacity, must consider
      you under my care,&mdash;as my guest, in fact,&mdash;although, owing to my
      casual absence, one of the brethren of the house has been the active
      instrument in attending you. I am most happy to find you so far recovered.
      Do you feel yourself in a condition to give any account of the accident
      which has befallen you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a very unsatisfactory one, at best,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, trying to
      discover some definite point in his misty reminiscences. &ldquo;I am a stranger
      to this country, and was on a pedestrian tour with the purpose of making
      myself acquainted with the aspects of English scenery and life. I had
      turned into a footpath, being told that it would lead me within view of an
      old Hall, which, from certain early associations, I was very desirous of
      seeing. I think I went astray; at all events, the path became indistinct;
      and, so far as I can recollect, I had just turned to retrace my steps,&mdash;in
      fact, that is the last thing in my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had almost fallen a sacrifice,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;to the old
      preference which our English gentry have inherited from their Norman
      ancestry, of game to man. You had come unintentionally as an intruder into
      a rich preserve much haunted by poachers, and exposed yourself to the
      deadly mark of a spring-gun, which had not the wit to distinguish between
      a harmless traveller and a poacher. At least, such is our conclusion; for
      our old friend here, (who luckily for you is a great rambler in the
      woods,) when the report drew him to the spot, found you insensible, and
      the gun discharged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gun has so little discretion,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, smiling, &ldquo;that it seems
      a pity to trust entirely to its judgment, in a matter of life and death.
      But, to confess the truth, I had come this morning to the suspicion that
      there was a direct human agency in the matter; for I find missing a little
      pocket-book which I carried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;that certainly gives a new aspect to the affair.
      Was it of value?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of none whatever,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;merely containing pencil memoranda,
      and notes of a traveller&rsquo;s little expenses. I had papers about me of far
      more value, and a moderate sum of money, a letter of credit, which have
      escaped. I do not, however, feel inclined, on such grounds, to transfer
      the guilt decidedly from the spring-gun to any more responsible criminal;
      for it is very possible that the pocket-book, being carelessly carried,
      might have been lost on the way. I had not used it since the preceding
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much more probable, indeed,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;The discharged gun is
      strong evidence against itself. Mr. Colcord,&rdquo; continued he, raising his
      voice, &ldquo;how long was the interval between the discharge of the gun and
      your arrival on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes, or less,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;for I was not far off, and
      made what haste I could, it being borne in on my spirit that mischief was
      abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear two reports?&rdquo; asked the Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one,&rdquo; replied Colcord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a plain case against the spring-gun,&rdquo; said the Warden; &ldquo;and, as you
      tell me you are a stranger, I trust you will not suppose that our peaceful
      English woods and parks are the haunt of banditti. We must try to give you
      a better idea of us. May I ask, are you an American, and recently come
      among us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe a letter of credit is considered as decisive as most modes of
      introduction,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, feeling that the good Warden was desirous
      of knowing with some precision who and what he was, and that, in the
      circumstances, he had a right to such knowledge. &ldquo;Here is mine, on a
      respectable house in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Warden took it, and glanced it over with a slight apologetic bow; it
      was a credit for a handsome amount in favor of the Honorable Edward
      Redclyffe, a title that did not fail to impress the Englishman rather
      favorably towards his new acquaintance, although he happened to know
      something of their abundance, even so early in the republic, among the men
      branded sons of equality. But, at all events, it showed no ordinary
      ability and energy for so young a man to have held such position as this
      title denoted in the fiercely contested political struggles of the new
      democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Redclyffe, that this name is familiar to us,
      hereabouts?&rdquo; asked he, with a kindly bow and recognition,&mdash;&ldquo;that it
      is in fact the principal name in this neighborhood,&mdash;that a family of
      your name still possesses Braithwaite Hall, and that this very Hospital,
      where you have happily found shelter, was founded by former
      representatives of your name? Perhaps you count yourself among their
      kindred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My countrymen are apt to advance claims to kinship with distinguished
      English families on such slight grounds as to make it ridiculous,&rdquo; said
      Redclyffe, coloring. &ldquo;I should not choose to follow so absurd an example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, perhaps not,&rdquo; said the Warden, laughing frankly. &ldquo;I have been
      amongst your republicans myself, a long while ago, and saw that your
      countrymen have no adequate idea of the sacredness of pedigrees, and
      heraldic distinctions, and would change their own names at pleasure, and
      vaunt kindred with an English duke on the strength of the assumed one. But
      I am happy to meet an American gentleman who looks upon this matter as
      Englishmen necessarily must. I met with great kindness in your country,
      Mr. Redclyffe, and shall be truly happy if you will allow me an
      opportunity of returning some small part of the obligation. You are now in
      a condition for removal to my own quarters, across the quadrangle. I will
      give orders to prepare an apartment, and you must transfer yourself there
      by dinner-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this hospitable proposal, so decisively expressed, the Warden took
      his leave; and Edward Redclyffe had hardly yet recovered sufficient
      independent force to reject an invitation so put, even were he inclined;
      but, in truth, the proposal suited well with his wishes, such as they
      were, and was, moreover, backed, it is singular to say, by another of
      those dreamlike recognitions which had so perplexed him ever since he
      found himself in the Hospital. In some previous state of being, the Warden
      and he had talked together before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the Warden&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; he inquired of the old pensioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hammond,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;he is a kinsman of the Redclyffe family
      himself, a man of fortune, and spends more than the income of his
      wardenship in beautifying and keeping up the glory of the establishment.
      He takes great pride in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has been in America,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;How strange! I knew him
      there. Never was anything so singular as the discovery of old
      acquaintances where I had reason to suppose myself unknowing and unknown.
      Unless dear Doctor Grim, or dear little Elsie, were to start up and greet
      me, I know not what may chance next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe took up his quarters in the Warden&rsquo;s house the next day, and was
      installed in an apartment that made a picture, such as he had not before
      seen, of English household comfort. He was thus established under the good
      Warden&rsquo;s roof, and, being very attractive of most people&rsquo;s sympathies,
      soon began to grow greatly in favor with that kindly personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Edward Redclyffe removed from the old pensioner&rsquo;s narrow quarters to
      the far ampler accommodations of the Warden&rsquo;s house, the latter gentleman
      was taking his morning exercise on horseback. A servant, however, in a
      grave livery, ushered him to an apartment, where the new guest was
      surprised to see some luggage which two or three days before Edward had
      ordered from London, on finding that his stay in this part of the country
      was likely to be much longer than he had originally contemplated. The
      sight of these things&mdash;the sense which they conveyed that he was an
      expected and welcome guest&mdash;tended to raise the spirits of the
      solitary wanderer, and made him.... [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Warden&rsquo;s abode was an original part of the ancient establishment,
      being an entire side of the quadrangle which the whole edifice surrounded;
      and for the establishment of a bachelor (which was his new friend&rsquo;s
      condition), it seemed to Edward Redclyffe abundantly spacious and enviably
      comfortable. His own chamber had a grave, rich depth, as it were, of
      serene and time-long garniture, for purposes of repose, convenience, daily
      and nightly comfort, that it was soothing even to look at. Long
      accustomed, as Redclyffe had been, to the hardy and rude accommodations,
      if so they were to be called, of log huts and hasty, mud-built houses in
      the Western States of America, life, its daily habits, its passing
      accommodations, seemed to assume an importance, under these aspects, which
      it had not worn before; those deep downy beds, those antique chairs, the
      heavy carpet, the tester and curtains, the stateliness of the old room,&mdash;they
      had a charm as compared with the thin preparation of a forester&rsquo;s
      bedchamber, such as Redclyffe had chiefly known them, in the ruder parts
      of the country, that really seemed to give a more substantial value to
      life; so much pains had been taken with its modes and appliances, that it
      looked more solid than before. Nevertheless, there was something ghostly
      in that stately curtained bed, with the deep gloom within its drapery, so
      ancient as it was; and suggestive of slumberers there who had long since
      slumbered elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old servant, whose grave, circumspect courtesy was a matter quite
      beyond Redclyffe&rsquo;s experience, soon knocked at the chamber door, and
      suggested that the guest might desire to await the Warden&rsquo;s arrival in the
      library, which was the customary sitting-room. Redclyffe assenting, he was
      ushered into a spacious apartment, lighted by various Gothic windows,
      surrounded with old oaken cases, in which were ranged volumes, most or
      many of which seemed to be coeval with the foundation of the hospital; and
      opening one of them, Redclyffe saw for the first time in his life
      [Endnote: 2] a genuine book-worm, that ancient form of creature living
      upon literature; it had gnawed a circular hole, penetrating through
      perhaps a score of pages of the seldom opened volume, and was still at his
      musty feast. There was a fragrance of old learning in this ancient
      library; a soothing influence, as the American felt, of time-honored
      ideas, where the strife, novelties, uneasy agitating conflict, attrition
      of unsettled theories, fresh-springing thought, did not attain a foothold;
      a good place to spend a life which should not be agitated with the
      disturbing element; so quiet, so peaceful; how slowly, with how little
      wear, would the years pass here! How unlike what he had hitherto known,
      and was destined to know,&mdash;the quick, violent struggle of his mother
      country, which had traced lines in his young brow already. How much would
      be saved by taking his former existence, not as dealing with things yet
      malleable, but with fossils, things that had had their life, and now were
      unchangeable, and revered, here!
    </p>
    <p>
      At one end of this large room there was a bowed window, the space near
      which was curtained off from the rest of the library, and, the window
      being filled with painted glass (most of which seemed old, though there
      were insertions evidently of modern and much inferior handiwork), there
      was a rich gloom of light, or you might call it a rich glow, according to
      your mood of mind. Redclyffe soon perceived that this curtained recess was
      the especial study of his friend, the Warden, and as such was provided
      with all that modern times had contrived for making an enjoyment out of
      the perusal of old books; a study table, with every convenience of
      multifarious devices, a great inkstand, pens; a luxurious study chair,
      where thought [Endnote: 3] upon. To say the truth, there was not, in this
      retired and thoughtful nook, anything that indicated to Redclyffe that the
      Warden had been recently engaged in consultation of learned authorities,&mdash;or
      in abstract labor, whether moral, metaphysical or historic; there was a
      volume of translations of Mother Goose&rsquo;s Melodies into Greek and Latin,
      printed for private circulation, and with the Warden&rsquo;s name on the
      title-page; a London newspaper of the preceding day; Lillebullero, Chevy
      Chase, and the old political ballads; and, what a little amused Redclyffe,
      the three volumes of a novel from a circulating library; so that Redclyffe
      came to the conclusion that the good Warden, like many educated men, whose
      early scholastic propensities are backed up by the best of opportunities,
      and all desirable facilities and surroundings, still contented himself
      with gathering a flower or two, instead of attempting the hard toil
      requisite to raise a crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be omitted, that there was a fragrance in the room, which,
      unlike as the scene was, brought back, through so many years, to
      Redclyffe&rsquo;s mind a most vivid remembrance of poor old Doctor Grim&rsquo;s
      squalid chamber, with his wild, bearded presence in the midst of it,
      puffing his everlasting cloud; for here was the same smell of tobacco, and
      on the mantel-piece of a chimney lay a German pipe, and an old silver
      tobacco-box into which was wrought the leopard&rsquo;s head and the inscription
      in black letter. The Warden had evidently availed himself of one of the
      chief bachelor sources of comfort. Redclyffe, whose destiny had hitherto,
      and up to a very recent period, been to pass a feverishly active life, was
      greatly impressed by all these tokens of learned ease,&mdash;a degree of
      self-indulgence combined with duties enough to quiet an otherwise uneasy
      conscience,&mdash;by the consideration that this pensioner acted a good
      part in a world where no one is entitled to be an unprofitable laborer. He
      thought within himself, that his prospects in his own galvanized country,
      that seemed to him, a few years since, to offer such a career for an
      adventurous young man, conscious of motive power, had nothing so enticing
      as such a nook as this,&mdash;a quiet recess of unchangeable old time,
      around which the turbulent tide now eddied and rushed, but could not
      disturb it. Here, to be sure, hope, love, ambition, came not, progress
      came not; but here was what, just now, the early wearied American could
      appreciate better than aught else,&mdash;here was rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fantasy took Edward to imitate the useful labors of the learned
      Warden, and to make trial whether his own classical condition&mdash;the
      results of Doctor Grim&rsquo;s tuition, and subsequently that of an American
      College&mdash;had utterly deserted him, by attempting a translation of a
      few verses of Yankee Doodle; and he was making hopeful progress when the
      Warden came in fresh and rosy from a morning&rsquo;s ride in a keen east wind.
      He shook hands heartily with his guest, and, though by no means frigid at
      their former interview, seemed to have developed at once into a kindlier
      man, now that he had suffered the stranger to cross his threshold, and had
      thus made himself responsible for his comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take it greatly amiss,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you do not pick up fast
      under my roof, and gather a little English ruddiness, moreover, in the
      walks and rides that I mean to take you. Your countrymen, as I saw them,
      are a sallow set; but I think you must have English blood enough in your
      veins to eke out a ruddy tint, with the help of good English beef and ale,
      and daily draughts of wholesome light and air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cheeks would not have been so very pale,&rdquo; said Edward, laughing, &ldquo;if
      an English shot had not deprived me of a good deal of my American blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only follow my guidance,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;and I assure you you shall
      have back whatever blood we have deprived you of, together with an
      addition. It is now luncheon-time, and we will begin the process of
      replenishing your veins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went into a refectory, where were spread upon the board what might
      have seemed a goodly dinner to most Americans; though for this Englishman
      it was but a by-incident, a slight refreshment, to enable him to pass the
      midway stage of life. It is an excellent thing to see the faith of a
      hearty Englishman in his own stomach, and how well that kindly organ
      repays his trust; with what devout assimilation he takes to himself his
      kindred beef, loving it, believing in it, making a good use of it, and
      without any qualms of conscience or prescience as to the result. They
      surely eat twice as much as we; and probably because of their undoubted
      faith it never does them any harm. Dyspepsia is merely a superstition with
      us. If we could cease to believe in its existence, it would exist no more.
      Redclyffe, eating little himself, his wound compelling him to be cautious
      as to his diet, was secretly delighted to see what sweets the Warden found
      in a cold round of beef, in a pigeon pie, and a cut or two of Yorkshire
      ham; not that he was ravenous, but that his stomach was so healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You eat little, my friend,&rdquo; said the Warden, pouring out a glass of
      sherry for Redclyffe, and another for himself. &ldquo;But you are right, in such
      a predicament as yours. Spare your stomach while you are weakly, and it
      will help you when you are strong This, now, is the most enjoyable meal of
      the day with me. You will not see me play such a knife and fork at dinner;
      though there too, especially if I have ridden out in the afternoon, I do
      pretty well. But, come now, if (like most of your countrymen, as I have
      heard) you are a lover of the weed, I can offer you some as delicate
      Latakia as you are likely to find in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lack that claim upon your kindness, I am sorry to say,&rdquo; replied
      Redclyffe. &ldquo;I am not a good smoker, though I have occasionally taken a
      cigar at need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when you find yourself growing old, and especially if you chance to
      be a bachelor, I advise you to cultivate the habit,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;A
      wife is the only real obstacle or objection to a pipe; they can seldom be
      thoroughly reconciled, and therefore it is well for a man to consider,
      beforehand, which of the two he can best dispense with. I know not how it
      might have been once, had the conflicting claim of these two rivals ever
      been fairly presented to me; but I now should be at no loss to choose the
      pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the study; and while the Warden took his pipe, Redclyffe,
      considering that, as the guest of this hospitable Englishman, he had no
      right to continue a stranger, thought it fit to make known to him who he
      was, and his condition, plans, and purposes. He represented himself as
      having been liberally educated, bred to the law, but (to his misfortune)
      having turned aside from that profession to engage in politics. In this
      pursuit, indeed, his success wore a flattering outside; for he had become
      distinguished, and, though so young, a leader, locally at least, in the
      party which he had adopted. He had been, for a biennial term, a member of
      Congress, after winning some distinction in the legislature of his native
      State; but some one of those fitful changes to which American politics are
      peculiarly liable had thrown him out, in his candidacy for his second
      term; and the virulence of party animosity, the abusiveness of the press,
      had acted so much upon a disposition naturally somewhat too sensitive for
      the career which he had undertaken, that he had resolved, being now freed
      from legislative cares, to seize the opportunity for a visit to England,
      whither he was drawn by feelings which every educated and impressible
      American feels, in a degree scarcely conceivable by the English
      themselves. And being here (but he had already too much experience of
      English self-sufficiency to confess so much) he began to feel the deep
      yearning which a sensitive American&mdash;his mind full of English
      thoughts, his imagination of English poetry, his heart of English
      character and sentiment&mdash;cannot fail to be influenced by,&mdash;the
      yearning of the blood within his veins for that from which it has been
      estranged; the half-fanciful regret that he should ever have been
      separated from these woods, these fields, these natural features of
      scenery, to which his nature was moulded, from the men who are still so
      like himself, from these habits of life and thought which (though he may
      not have known them for two centuries) he still perceives to have remained
      in some mysterious way latent in the depths of his character, and soon to
      be reassumed, not as a foreigner would do it, but like habits native to
      him, and only suspended for a season.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had been Redclyffe&rsquo;s state of feeling ever since he landed in
      England, and every day seemed to make him more at home; so that it seemed
      as if he were gradually awakening to a former reality.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After lunch, the Warden showed a good degree of kind anxiety about his
      guest, and ensconced him in a most comfortable chair in his study, where
      he gave him his choice of books old and new, and was somewhat surprised,
      as well as amused, to see that Redclyffe seemed most attracted towards a
      department of the library filled with books of English antiquities, and
      genealogies, and heraldry; the two latter, indeed, having the preference
      over the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very remarkable,&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;By what right or reason, by
      what logic of character, can you, a democrat, renouncing all advantages of
      birth,&mdash;neither priding yourself on family, nor seeking to found one,&mdash;how
      therefore can you care for genealogies, or for this fantastic science of
      heraldry? Having no antiquities, being a people just made, how can you
      care for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;I doubt whether the most devoted
      antiquarian in England ever cares to search for an old thing merely
      because it is old, as any American just landed on your shores would do.
      Age is our novelty; therefore it attracts and absorbs us. And as for
      genealogies, I know not what necessary repulsion there may be between it
      and democracy. A line of respectable connections, being the harder to
      preserve where there is nothing in the laws to defend it, is therefore the
      more precious when we have it really to boast of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;when a race keeps itself distinguished among the
      grimy order of your commonalty, all with equal legal rights to place and
      eminence as itself, it must needs be because there is a force and efficacy
      in the blood. I doubt not,&rdquo; he said, looking with the free approval of an
      elder man at the young man&rsquo;s finely developed face and graceful form,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      doubt not that you can look back upon a line of ancestry, always shining
      out from the surrounding obscurity of the mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe, though ashamed of himself, could not but feel a paltry
      confusion and embarrassment, as he thought of his unknown origin, and his
      advent from the almshouse; coming out of that squalid darkness as if he
      were a thing that had had a spontaneous birth out of poverty, meanness,
      petty crime; and here in ancestral England, he felt more keenly than ever
      before what was his misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not let you lie under this impression,&rdquo; said he manfully to the
      Warden. &ldquo;I have no ancestry; at the very first step my origin is lost in
      impenetrable obscurity. I only know that but for the aid of a kind friend&mdash;on
      whose benevolence I seem to have had no claim whatever&mdash;my life would
      probably have been poor, mean, unenlightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the kind Warden,&mdash;hardly quite feeling, however,
      the noble sentiment which he expressed,&mdash;&ldquo;it is better to be the
      first noble illustrator of a name than even the worthy heir of a name that
      has been noble and famous for a thousand years. The highest pride of some
      of our peers, who have won their rank by their own force, has been to
      point to the cottage whence they sprung. Your posterity, at all events,
      will have the advantage of you,&mdash;they will know their ancestor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe sighed, for there was truly a great deal of the foolish yearning
      for a connection with the past about him; his imagination had taken this
      turn, and the very circumstances of his obscure birth gave it a field to
      exercise itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you,&rdquo; said the Warden, by way of changing the conversation, &ldquo;to
      look over the excellent history of the county which you are now in. There
      is no reading better, to my mind, than these country histories; though
      doubtless a stranger would hardly feel so much interest in them as one
      whose progenitors, male or female, have strewn their dust over the whole
      field of which the history treats. This history is a fine specimen of the
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The work to which Redclyffe&rsquo;s attention was thus drawn was in two large
      folio volumes, published about thirty years before, bound in calf by some
      famous artist in that line, illustrated with portraits and views of ruined
      castles, churches, cathedrals, the seats of nobility and gentry; Roman,
      British, and Saxon remains, painted windows, oak carvings, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as for its contents the author ascended for the history of the county
      as far as into the pre-Roman ages, before Caesar had ever heard of
      Britain; and brought it down, an ever swelling and increasing tale, to his
      own days; inclusive of the separate histories, and pedigrees, and
      hereditary legends, and incidents, of all the principal families. In this
      latter branch of information, indeed, the work seemed particularly full,
      and contained every incident that would have worked well into historical
      romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said the Warden, laughing at some strange incident of this
      sort which Redclyffe read out to him. &ldquo;My old friend Gibber, the learned
      author of this work, (he has been dead this score of years, so he will not
      mind my saying it,) had a little too much the habit of seeking his
      authorities in the cottage chimney-corners. I mean that an old woman&rsquo;s
      tale was just about as acceptable to him as a recorded fact; and to say
      the truth, they are really apt to have ten times the life in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe saw in the volume a full account of the founding of the
      Hospital, its regulations and purposes, its edifices; all of which he
      reserved for future reading, being for the present more attracted by the
      mouldy gossip of family anecdotes which we have alluded to. Some of these,
      and not the least singular, referred to the ancient family which had
      founded the Hospital; and he was attracted by seeing a mention of a Bloody
      Footstep, which reminded him of the strange old story which good Doctor
      Grimshawe had related by his New England fireside, in those childish days
      when Edward dwelt with him by the graveyard, On reading it, however, he
      found that the English legend, if such it could be called, was far less
      full and explicit than that of New England. Indeed, it assigned various
      origins to the Bloody Footstep;&mdash;one being, that it was the stamp of
      the foot of the Saxon thane, who fought at his own threshold against the
      assault of the Norman baron, who seized his mansion at the Conquest;
      another, that it was the imprint of a fugitive who had sought shelter from
      the lady of the house during the Wars of the Roses, and was dragged out by
      her husband, and slain on the door-step; still another, that it was the
      footstep of a Protestant in Bloody Mary&rsquo;s days, who, being sent to prison
      by the squire of that epoch, had lifted his hands to Heaven, and stamped
      his foot, in appeal as against the unjust violence with which he was
      treated, and stamping his foot, it had left the bloody mark. It was hinted
      too, however, that another version, which out of delicacy to the family
      the author was reluctant to state, assigned the origin of the Bloody
      Footstep to so late a period as the wars of the Parliament. And, finally,
      there was an odious rumor that what was called the Bloody Footstep was
      nothing miraculous, after all, but most probably a natural reddish stain
      in the stone door-step; but against this heresy the excellent Dr. Gibber
      set his face most sturdily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original legend had made such an impression on Redclyffe&rsquo;s childish
      fancy, that he became strangely interested in thus discovering it, or
      something remotely like it, in England, and being brought by such unsought
      means to reside so near it. Curious about the family to which it had
      occurred, he proceeded to examine its records, as given in the County
      History. The name was Redclyffe. Like most English pedigrees, there was an
      obscurity about a good many of the earlier links; but the line was traced
      out with reasonable definiteness from the days of Coeur de Lion, and there
      was said to be a cross-legged ancestor in the village church, who (but the
      inscription was obliterated) was probably a Redclyffe, and had fought
      either under the Lion Heart or in the Crusades. It was, in subsequent
      ages, one of the most distinguished families, though there had been
      turbulent men in all those turbulent times, hard fighters. In one age, a
      barony of early creation seemed to have come into the family, and had
      been, as it were, playing bo-peep with the race for several centuries.
      Some of them had actually assumed the title; others had given it up for
      lack of sufficient proof; but still there was such a claim, and up to the
      time at which this County History was written, it had neither been made
      out, nor had the hope of doing so been relinquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the family,&rdquo; asked Redclyffe of his host, &ldquo;ever yet made out their
      claim to this title, which has so long been playing the will-of-the-wisp
      with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; said the Warden, puffing out a volume of smoke from his
      meerschaum, and making it curl up to the ceiling. &ldquo;Their claim has as
      little substance, in my belief, as yonder vanishing vapor from my pipe.
      But they still keep up their delusion. I had supposed that the claim would
      perish with the last squire, who was a childless man,&mdash;at least,
      without legitimate heirs; but this estate passed to one whom we can
      scarcely call an Englishman, he being a Catholic, the descendant of
      forefathers who have lived in Italy since the time of George II., and who
      is, moreover, a Catholic. We English would not willingly see an ancestral
      honor in the possession of such a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there, do you think, a prospect of his success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard so, but hardly believe it,&rdquo; replied the Warden. &ldquo;I remember,
      some dozen or fifteen years ago, it was given out that some clue had been
      found to the only piece of evidence that was wanting. It had been said
      that there was an emigration to your own country, above a hundred years
      ago, and on account of some family feud; the true heir had gone thither
      and never returned. Now, the point was to prove the extinction of this
      branch of the family. But, excuse me, I must pay an official visit to my
      charge here. Will you accompany me, or continue to pore over the County
      History?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe felt enough of the elasticity of convalescence to be desirous of
      accompanying the Warden; and they accordingly crossed the enclosed
      quadrangle to the entrance of the Hospital portion of the large and
      intricate structure. It was a building of the early Elizabethan age, a
      plaster and timber structure, like many houses of that period and much
      earlier. [Endnote: 1] Around this court stood the building, with the date
      1437 cut on the front. On each side, a row of gables looked upon the
      enclosed space, most venerable old gables, with heavy mullioned windows
      filled with little diamond panes of glass, and opening on lattices. On two
      sides there was a cloistered walk, under echoing arches, and in the midst
      a spacious lawn of the greenest and loveliest grass, such as England only
      can show, and which, there, is of perennial verdure and beauty. In the
      midst stood a stone statue of a venerable man, wrought in the best of
      mediæval sculpture, with robe and ruff, and tunic and venerable beard,
      resting on a staff, and holding what looked like a clasped book in his
      hand. The English atmosphere, together with the coal smoke, settling down
      in the space of centuries from the chimneys of the Hospital, had roughened
      and blackened this venerable piece of sculpture, enclosing it as it were
      in a superficies of decay; but still (and perhaps the more from these
      tokens of having stood so long among men) the statue had an aspect of
      venerable life, and of connection with human life, that made it strongly
      impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the effigy of Sir Edward Redclyffe, the founder of the Hospital,&rdquo;
       said the Warden. &ldquo;He is a most peaceful and venerable old gentleman in his
      attire and aspect, as you see; but he was a fierce old fellow in his day,
      and is said to have founded the Hospital as a means of appeasing Heaven
      for some particular deed of blood, which he had imposed upon his
      conscience in the War of the Roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;I have just read in the County History that the
      Bloody Footstep was said to have been imprinted in his time. But what is
      that thing which he holds in his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a famous heirloom of the Redclyffes,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;on the
      possession of which (as long as they did possess it) they prided
      themselves, it is said, more than on their ancient manor-house. It was a
      Saxon ornament, which a certain ancestor was said to have had from Harold,
      the old Saxon king; but if there ever was any such article, it has been
      missing from the family mansion for two or three hundred years. There is
      not known to be an antique relic of that description now in existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember having seen such an article,&mdash;yes, precisely of that
      shape,&rdquo; observed Redclyffe, &ldquo;in the possession of a very dear old friend
      of mine, when I was a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in America?&rdquo; exclaimed the Warden. &ldquo;That is very remarkable. The
      time of its being missed coincides well enough with that of the early
      settlement of New England. Some Puritan, before his departure, may have
      thought himself doing God service by filching the old golden gewgaw from
      the Cavalier; for it was said to be fine, ductile gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances struck Redclyffe with a pleasant wonder; for, indeed,
      the old statue held the closest possible imitation, in marble, of that
      strange old glitter of gold which he himself had so often played with in
      the Doctor&rsquo;s study; [Endnote: 2] so identical, that he could have fancied
      that he saw the very thing, changed from metal into stone, even with its
      bruises and other casual marks in it. As he looked at the old statue, his
      imagination played with it, and his naturally great impressibility half
      made him imagine that the old face looked at him with a keen, subtile,
      wary glance, as if acknowledging that it held some secret, but at the same
      time defying him to find it out. And then again came that visionary
      feeling that had so often swept over him since he had been an inmate of
      the Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      All over the interior part of the building was carved in stone the
      leopard&rsquo;s head, with wearisome iteration; as if the founder were anxious
      to imprint his device so numerously, lest&mdash;when he produced this
      edifice as his remuneration to Eternal Justice for many sins&mdash;the
      Omniscient Eye should fail to be reminded that Sir Edward Redclyffe had
      done it. But, at all events, it seemed to Redclyffe that the ancient
      knight had purposed a good thing, and in a measurable degree had effected
      it; for here stood the venerable edifice securely founded, bearing the
      moss of four hundred years upon it; and though wars, and change of
      dynasties, and religious change, had swept around it, with seemingly
      destructive potency, yet here had the lodging, the food, the monastic
      privileges of the brethren been held secure, and were unchanged by all the
      altering mariners of the age. The old fellow, somehow or other, seemed to
      have struck upon an everlasting rock, and founded his pompous charity
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered an arched door on the left of the quadrangle, and found
      themselves hi a dark old hall with oaken beams; to say the truth, it was a
      barn-like sort of enclosure, and was now used as a sort of rubbish-place
      for the Hospital, where they stored away old furniture, and where
      carpenter&rsquo;s work might be done. And yet, as the Warden assured Redclyffe,
      it was once a hall of state, hung with tapestry, carpeted, for aught he
      knew, with cloth of gold, and set with rich furniture, and a groaning
      board in the midst. Here, the hereditary patron of the Hospital had once
      entertained King James the First, who made a Latin speech on the occasion,
      a copy of which was still preserved in the archives. On the rafters of
      this old hall there were cobwebs in such abundance that Redclyffe could
      not but reflect on the joy which old Doctor Grimshawe would have had in
      seeing them, and the health to the human race which he would have hoped to
      collect and distil from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this great, antique room they crossed the quadrangle and entered the
      kitchen of the establishment. A hospitable fire was burning there, and
      there seemed to be a great variety of messes cooking; and the Warden
      explained to Redclyffe that there was no general table in the Hospital;
      but the brethren, at their own will and pleasure, either formed themselves
      into companies or messes, of any convenient size, or enjoyed a solitary
      meal by themselves, each in their own apartments. There was a goodly
      choice of simple, but good and enjoyable food, and a sufficient supply of
      potent ale, brewed in the vats of the Hospital, which, among its other
      praiseworthy characteristics, was famous for this; having at some epoch
      presumed to vie with the famous ale of Trinity, in Cambridge, and the
      Archdeacon of Oxford,&mdash;these having come down to the hospital from a
      private receipt of Sir Edward&rsquo;s butler, which was now lost in the
      Redclyffe family; nor would the ungrateful Hospital give up its secret
      even out of loyalty to its founder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would use my influence with the brewer,&rdquo; said the Warden, on
      communicating this little fact to Redclyffe; &ldquo;but the present man&mdash;now
      owner of the estate&mdash;is not worthy to have good ale brewed in his
      house; having himself no taste for anything but Italian wines, wretched
      fellow that he is! He might make himself an Englishman if he would take
      heartily to our ale; and with that end in view, I should be glad to give
      it him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen fire blazed warmly, as we have said, and roast and stewed and
      boiled were in process of cooking, producing a pleasant fume, while great
      heaps of wheaten loaves were smoking hot from the ovens, and the master
      cook and his subordinates were in fume and hiss, like beings that were of
      a fiery element, and, though irritable and scorching, yet were happier
      here than they could have been in any other situation. The Warden seemed
      to have an especial interest and delight in this department of the
      Hospital, and spoke apart to the head cook on the subject (as Redclyffe
      surmised from what he overheard) of some especial delicacy for his own
      table that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This kitchen is a genial place,&rdquo; said he to Redclyffe, as they retired.
      &ldquo;In the evening, after the cooks have done their work, the brethren have
      liberty to use it as a sort of common room, and to sit here over their ale
      till a reasonable bedtime. It would interest you much to make one at such
      a party; for they have had a varied experience in life, each one for
      himself, and it would be strange to hear the varied roads by which they
      have come hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Redclyffe, &ldquo;and, I presume, not one of them ever dreamed of
      coming hither when he started in life. The only one with whom I am
      acquainted could hardly have expected it, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a remarkable man, more so than you may have had an opportunity of
      knowing,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;I know not his history, for he is not
      communicative on that subject, and it was only necessary for him to make
      out his proofs of claim to the charity to the satisfaction of the
      Curators. But it has often struck me that there must have been strange and
      striking events in his life,&mdash;though how it could have been without
      his attracting attention and being known, I cannot say. I have myself
      often received good counsel from him in the conduct of the Hospital, and
      the present owner of the Hall seems to have taken him for his counsellor
      and confidant, being himself strange to English affairs and life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to call on him, as a matter of course rather than
      courtesy,&rdquo; observed Redclyffe, &ldquo;and thank him for his great kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly ascended the dark oaken staircase with its black
      balustrade, and approached the old man&rsquo;s chamber, the door of which they
      found open, and in the blurred looking-glass which hung deep within the
      room Redclyffe was surprised to perceive the young face of a woman, who
      seemed to be arranging her head-gear, as women are always doing. It was
      but a moment, and then it vanished like a vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware,&rdquo; he said, turning to the Warden, &ldquo;that there was a
      feminine side to this establishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor is there,&rdquo; said the old bachelor, &ldquo;else it would not have held
      together so many ages as it has. The establishment has its own wise,
      monkish regulations; but we cannot prevent the fact, that some of the
      brethren may have had foolish relations with the other sex at some
      previous period of their lives. This seems to be the case with our wise
      old friend of whom we have been speaking,&mdash;whereby he doubtless
      became both wiser and sadder. If you have seen a female face here, it is
      that of a relative who resides out of the hospital,&mdash;an excellent
      young lady, I believe, who has charge of a school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was speaking, the young lady in question passed out, greeting the
      Warden in a cheerful, respectful way, in which deference to him was well
      combined with a sense of what was due to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; observed the Warden, who had returned her courtesy, with a kindly
      air betwixt that of gentlemanly courtesy and a superior&rsquo;s acknowledgment,&mdash;&ldquo;that
      is the relative of our old friend; a young person&mdash;a gentlewoman, I
      may almost call her&mdash;who teaches a little school in the village here,
      and keeps her guardian&rsquo;s heart warm, no doubt, with her presence. An
      excellent young woman, I do believe, and very useful and faithful in her
      station.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the old palmer&rsquo;s apartment, they found him looking over some
      ancient papers, yellow and crabbedly written, and on one of them a large
      old seal, all of which he did up in a bundle and enclosed in a parchment
      cover, so that, before they were well in the room, the documents were
      removed from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those papers and parchments have a fine old yellow tint, Colcord,&rdquo; said
      the Warden, &ldquo;very satisfactory to an antiquary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing in them,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;of general interest. Some
      old papers they are, which came into my possession by inheritance, and
      some of them relating to the affairs of a friend of my youth;&mdash;a long
      past time, and a long past friend,&rdquo; added he, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a new friend, at all events,&rdquo; said the kindly Warden, wishing to
      cheer the old man, &ldquo;who feels himself greatly indebted to you for your
      care.&rdquo; [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      There now ensued a conversation between the three, in the course of which
      reference was made to America, and the Warden&rsquo;s visit there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so mobile,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you change so speedily, that I suppose
      there are few external things now that I should recognize. The face of
      your country changes like one of your own sheets of water, under the
      influence of sun, cloud, and wind; but I suppose there is a depth below
      that is seldom effectually stirred. It is a great fault of the country
      that its sons find it impossible to feel any patriotism for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not by any means acknowledge that impossibility,&rdquo; responded
      Redclyffe, with a smile. &ldquo;I certainly feel that sentiment very strongly in
      my own breast, more especially since I have left America three thousand
      miles behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is only the feeling of self-assertion that rises against the
      self-complacency of the English,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;Nothing else; for what
      else have you become the subject of this noble weakness of patriotism? You
      cannot love anything beyond the soil of your own estate; or in your case,
      if your heart is very large, you may possibly take in, in a quiet sort of
      way, the whole of New England. What more is possible? How can you feel a
      heart&rsquo;s love for a mere political arrangement, like your Union? How can
      you be loyal, where personal attachment&mdash;the lofty and noble and
      unselfish attachment of a subject to his prince&mdash;is out of the
      question? where your sovereign is felt to be a mere man like yourselves,
      whose petty struggles, whose ambition&mdash;mean before it grew to be
      audacious&mdash;you have watched, and know him to be just the same now as
      yesterday, and that to-morrow he will be walking unhonored amongst you
      again? Your system is too bare and meagre for human nature to love, or to
      endure it long. These stately degrees of society, that have so strong a
      hold upon us in England, are not to be done away with so lightly as you
      think. Your experiment is not yet a success by any means; and you will
      live to see it result otherwise than you think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is natural for you Englishmen to feel thus,&rdquo; said Redclyffe;
      &ldquo;although, ever since I set my foot on your shores,&mdash;forgive me, but
      you set me the example of free speech,&mdash;I have had a feeling of
      coming change among all that you look upon as so permanent, so
      everlasting; and though your thoughts dwell fondly on things as they are
      and have been, there is a deep destruction somewhere in this country, that
      is inevitably impelling it in the path of my own. But I care not for this.
      I do aver that I love my country, that I am proud of its institutions,
      that I have a feeling unknown, probably, to any but a republican, but
      which is the proudest thing in me, that there is no man above me,&mdash;for
      my ruler is only myself, in the person of another, whose office I impose
      upon him,&mdash;nor any below me. If you would understand me, I would tell
      you of the shame I felt when first, on setting foot in this country, I
      heard a man speaking of his birth as giving him privileges; saw him
      looking down on laboring men, as of an inferior race. And what I can never
      understand, is the pride which you positively seem to feel in having men
      and classes of men above you, born to privileges which you can never hope
      to share. It may be a thing to be endured, but surely not one to be
      absolutely proud of. And yet an Englishman is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see we lack a ground to meet upon,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;We can never
      truly understand each other. What you have last mentioned is one of our
      inner mysteries. It is not a thing to be reasoned about, but to be felt,&mdash;to
      be born within one; and I uphold it to be a generous sentiment, and good
      for the human heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, sir,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;but I would rather be the poorest and
      lowest man in America than have that sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it might change your feeling, perhaps,&rdquo; suggested the Warden, &ldquo;if you
      were one of the privileged class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not say that it would not,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;for I know I have a
      thousand weaknesses, and have doubtless as many more that I never
      suspected myself of. But it seems to me at this moment impossible that I
      should ever have such an ambition, because I have a sense of meanness in
      not starting fair, in beginning the world with advantages that my fellows
      have not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really this is not wise,&rdquo; said the Warden, bluntly, &ldquo;How can the start in
      life be fair for all? Providence arranges it otherwise. Did you yourself,&mdash;a
      gentleman evidently by birth and education,&mdash;did you start fair in
      the race of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe remembered what his birth, or rather what his first recollected
      place had been, and reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In birth, certainly, I had no advantages,&rdquo; said he, and would have
      explained further but was kept back by invincible reluctance; feeling that
      the bare fact of his origin in an almshouse would be accepted, while all
      the inward assurances and imaginations that had reconciled himself to the
      ugly fact would go for nothing. &ldquo;But there were advantages, very early in
      life,&rdquo; added he, smiling, &ldquo;which perhaps I ought to have been ashamed to
      avail myself of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old cobwebby library,&mdash;an old dwelling by a graveyard,&mdash;an
      old Doctor, busied with his own fantasies, and entangled in his own
      cobwebs,&mdash;and a little girl for a playmate: these were things that
      you might lawfully avail yourself of,&rdquo; said Colcord, unheard by the
      Warden, who, thinking the conversation had lasted long enough, had paid a
      slight passing courtesy to the old man, and was now leaving the room. &ldquo;Do
      you remain here long?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Warden&rsquo;s hospitality holds out,&rdquo; said the American, &ldquo;I shall be
      glad; for the place interests me greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; replied Colcord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore no wonder?&rdquo; said Redclyffe, impressed with the idea that
      there was something peculiar in the tone of the old man&rsquo;s remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; returned the other quietly, &ldquo;it must be to you especially
      interesting to see an institution of this kind, whereby one man&rsquo;s
      benevolence or penitence is made to take the substance and durability of
      stone, and last for centuries; whereas, in America, the solemn decrees and
      resolutions of millions melt away like vapor, and everything shifts like
      the pomp of sunset clouds; though it may be as pompous as they. Heaven
      intended the past as a foundation for the present, to keep it from
      vibrating and being blown away with every breeze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;I would not see in my country what I see
      elsewhere,&mdash;the Past hanging like a mill-stone round a country&rsquo;s
      neck, or encrusted in stony layers over the living form; so that, to all
      intents and purposes, it is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Colcord, &ldquo;we are only talking of the Hospital. You will find
      no more interesting place anywhere. Stay amongst us; this is the very
      heart of England, and if you wish to know the fatherland,&mdash;the place
      whence you sprung,&mdash;this is the very spot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Redclyffe was struck with the impression that there was something
      marked, something individually addressed to himself, in the old man&rsquo;s
      words; at any rate, it appealed to that primal imaginative vein in him
      which had so often, in his own country, allowed itself to dream over the
      possibilities of his birth. He knew that the feeling was a vague and idle
      one; but yet, just at this time, a convalescent, with a little play moment
      in what had heretofore been a turbulent life, he felt an inclination to
      follow out this dream, and let it sport with him, and by and by to awake
      to realities, refreshed by a season of unreality. At a firmer and stronger
      period of his life, though Redclyffe might have indulged his imagination
      with these dreams, yet he would not have let them interfere with his
      course of action; but having come hither in utter weariness of active
      life, it seemed just the thing for him to do,&mdash;just the fool&rsquo;s
      paradise for him to be in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated the old man, looking keenly in his face, &ldquo;you will not
      leave us yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe returned through the quadrangle to the Warden&rsquo;s house; and there
      were the brethren, sitting on benches, loitering in the sun, which, though
      warm for England, seemed scarcely enough to keep these old people warm,
      even with their cloth robes. They did not seem unhappy; nor yet happy; if
      they were so, it must be with the mere bliss of existence, a sleepy sense
      of comfort, and quiet dreaminess about things past, leaving out the things
      to come,&mdash;of which there was nothing, indeed, in their future, save
      one day after another, just like this, with loaf and ale, and such
      substantial comforts, and prayers, and idle days again, gathering by the
      great kitchen fire, and at last a day when they should not be there, but
      some other old men in their stead. And Redclyffe wondered whether, in the
      extremity of age, he himself would like to be one of the brethren of the
      Leopard&rsquo;s Head. The old men, he was sorry to see, did not seem very genial
      towards one another; in fact, there appeared to be a secret enjoyment of
      one another&rsquo;s infirmities, wherefore it was hard to tell, unless that each
      individual might fancy himself to possess an advantage over his fellow,
      which he mistook for a positive strength; and so there was sometimes a
      sardonic smile, when, on rising from his seat, the rheumatism was a little
      evident in an old fellow&rsquo;s joints; or when the palsy shook another&rsquo;s
      fingers so that he could barely fill his pipe; or when a cough, the
      gathered spasmodic trouble of thirty years, fairly convulsed another.
      Then, any two that happened to be sitting near one another looked into
      each other&rsquo;s cold eyes, and whispered, or suggested merely by a look (for
      they were bright to such perceptions), &ldquo;The old fellow will not outlast
      another winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Methinks it is not good for old men to be much together. An old man is a
      beautiful object in his own place, in the midst of a circle of young
      people, going down in various gradations to infancy, and all looking up to
      the patriarch with filial reverence, keeping him warm by their own burning
      youth; giving him the freshness of their thought and feeling, with such
      natural influx that it seems as if it grew within his heart; while on them
      he reacts with an influence that sobers, tempers, keeps them down. His
      wisdom, very probably, is of no great account,&mdash;he cannot fit to any
      new state of things; but, nevertheless, it works its effect. In such a
      situation, the old man is kind and genial, mellow, more gentle and
      generous, and wider-minded than ever before. But if left to himself, or
      wholly to the society of his contemporaries, the ice gathers about his
      heart, his hope grows torpid, his love&mdash;having nothing of his own
      blood to develop it&mdash;grows cold; he becomes selfish, when he has
      nothing in the present or the future worth caring about in himself; so
      that, instead of a beautiful object, he is an ugly one, little, mean, and
      torpid. I suppose one chief reason to be, that unless he has his own race
      about him he doubts of anybody&rsquo;s love, he feels himself a stranger in the
      world, and so becomes unamiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few days in the Warden&rsquo;s hospitable mansion produced an excellent
      effect on Redclyffe&rsquo;s frame; his constitution being naturally excellent,
      and a flow of cheerful spirits contributing much to restore him to health,
      especially as the abode in this old place, which would probably have been
      intolerably dull to most young Englishmen, had for this young American a
      charm like the freshness of Paradise. In truth it had that charm, and
      besides it another intangible, evanescent, perplexing charm, full of an
      airy enjoyment, as if he had been here before. What could it be? It could
      be only the old, very deepest, inherent nature, which the Englishman, his
      progenitor, carried over the sea with him, nearly two hundred years
      before, and which had lain buried all that time under heaps of new things,
      new customs, new institutions, new snows of winter, new layers of forest
      leaves, until it seemed dead, and was altogether forgotten as if it had
      never been; but, now, his return had seemed to dissolve or dig away all
      this incrustation, and the old English nature awoke all fresh, so that he
      saw the green grass, the hedgerows, the old structures and old manners,
      the old clouds, the old raindrops, with a recognition, and yet a newness.
      Redclyffe had never been so quietly happy as now. He had, as it were, the
      quietude of the old man about him, and the freshness of his own still
      youthful years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Warden was evidently very favorably impressed with his Transatlantic
      guest, and he seemed to be in a constant state of surprise to find an
      American so agreeable a kind of person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just like an Englishman,&rdquo; he sometimes said. &ldquo;Are you quite sure
      that you were not born on this side of the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is said to be the highest compliment that an Englishman can pay to an
      American; and doubtless he intends it as such. All the praise and good
      will that an Englishman ever awards to an American is so far gratifying to
      the recipient, that it is meant for him individually, and is not to be put
      down in the slightest degree to the score of any regard to his countrymen
      generally. So far from this, if an Englishman were to meet the whole
      thirty millions of Americans, and find each individual of them a pleasant,
      amiable, well-meaning, and well-mannered sort of fellow, he would
      acknowledge this honestly in each individual case, but still would speak
      of the whole nation as a disagreeable people.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards Redclyffe being precisely like an Englishman, we cannot but
      think that the good Warden was mistaken. No doubt, there was a common
      ground; the old progenitor (whose blood, moreover, was mixed with a
      hundred other streams equally English) was still there, under this young
      man&rsquo;s shape, but with a vast difference. Climate, sun, cold, heat, soil,
      institutions, had made a change in him before he was born, and all the
      life that he had lived since (so unlike any that he could have lived in
      England) had developed it more strikingly. In manners, I cannot but think
      that he was better than the generality of Englishmen, and different from
      the highest-mannered men, though most resembling them. His natural
      sensitiveness, a tincture of reserve, had been counteracted by the frank
      mixture with men which his political course had made necessary; he was
      quicker to feel what was right at the moment, than the Englishman; more
      alive; he had a finer grain; his look was more aristocratic than that of a
      thousand Englishmen of good birth and breeding; he had a faculty of
      assimilating himself to new manners, which, being his most un-English
      trait, was what perhaps chiefly made the Warden think him so like an
      Englishman. When an Englishman is a gentleman, to be sure, it is as deep
      in him as the marrow of his bones, and the deeper you know him, the more
      you are aware of it, and that generation after generation has contributed
      to develop and perfect these unpretending manners, which, at first, may
      have failed to impress you, under his plain, almost homely exterior. An
      American often gets as good a surface of manners, in his own progress from
      youth, through the wear and attrition of a successful life, to some high
      station in middle age; whereas a plebeian Englishman, who rises to eminent
      station, never does credit to it by his manners. Often you would not know
      the American ambassador from a duke. This is often merely external; but in
      Redclyffe, having delicate original traits in his character, it was
      something more; and, we are bold to say, when our countrymen are
      developed, or any one class of them, as they ought to be, they will show
      finer traits than have yet been seen. We have more delicate and quicker
      sensibilities; nerves more easily impressed; and these are surely
      requisites for perfect manners; and, moreover, the courtesy that proceeds
      on the ground of perfect equality is better than that which is a gracious
      and benignant condescension,&mdash;as is the case with the manners of the
      aristocracy of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      An American, be it said, seldom turns his best side outermost abroad; and
      an observer, who has had much opportunity of seeing the figure which they
      make, in a foreign country, does not so much wonder that there should be
      severe criticism on their manners as a people. I know not exactly why, but
      all our imputed peculiarities&mdash;our nasal pronunciation, our
      ungraceful idioms, our forthputtingness, our uncouth lack of courtesy&mdash;do
      really seem to exist on a foreign shore; and even, perhaps, to be
      heightened of malice prepense. The cold, unbelieving eye of Englishmen,
      expectant of solecisms in manners, contributes to produce the result which
      it looks for. Then the feeling of hostility and defiance in the American
      must be allowed for; and partly, too, the real existence of a different
      code of manners, founded on, and arising from, different institutions; and
      also certain national peculiarities, which may be intrinsically as good as
      English peculiarities; but being different, and yet the whole result being
      just too nearly alike, and, moreover, the English manners having the
      prestige of long establishment, and furthermore our own manners being in a
      transition state between those of old monarchies and what is proper to a
      new republic,&mdash;it necessarily followed that the American, though
      really a man of refinement and delicacy, is not just the kind of gentleman
      that the English can fully appreciate. In cases where they do so, their
      standard being different from ours, they do not always select for their
      approbation the kind of man or manners whom we should judge the best; we
      are perhaps apt to be a little too fine, a little too sedulously polished,
      and of course too conscious of it,&mdash;a deadly social crime, certainly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To return from this long discussion, the Warden took kindly, as we have
      said, to Redclyffe, and thought him a miraculously good fellow, to have
      come from the rude American republic. Hitherto, in the little time that he
      had been in England, Redclyffe had received civil and even kind treatment
      from the English with whom he had come casually in contact; but still&mdash;perhaps
      partly from our Yankee narrowness and reserve&mdash;he had felt, in the
      closest coming together, as if there were a naked sword between the
      Englishman and him, as between the Arabian prince in the tale and the
      princess whom he wedded; he felt as if that would be the case even if he
      should love an Englishwoman; to such a distance, into such an attitude of
      self-defence, does English self-complacency and belief in England&rsquo;s
      superiority throw the stranger. In fact, in a good-natured way, John Bull
      is always doubling his fist in a stranger&rsquo;s face, and though it be
      good-natured, it does not always produce the most amiable feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Warden, being an Englishman, had doubtless the same kind of
      feeling; doubtless, too, he thought ours a poor, distracted country,
      perhaps prosperous for the moment, but as likely as not to be the scene of
      anarchy five minutes hence; but being of so genial a nature, when he came
      to see the amiableness of his young guest, and how deeply he was impressed
      with England, all prejudice died away, and he loved him like a treasure
      that he had found for himself, and valued him as if there were something
      of his own in him. And so the old Warden&rsquo;s residence had never before been
      so cheery as it was now; his bachelor life passed the more pleasantly with
      this quiet, vivacious, yet not troublesomely restless spirit beside him,&mdash;this
      eager, almost childish interest in everything English, and yet this
      capacity to take independent views of things, and sometimes, it might be,
      to throw a gleam of light even on things appertaining to England. And so,
      the better they came to know one another, the greater was their mutual
      liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I am getting too strong to burden you much longer,&rdquo; said
      Redclyffe, this morning. &ldquo;I have no pretence to be a patient now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense!&rdquo; ejaculated the Warden. &ldquo;It will not be safe to leave you
      to yourself for at least a month to come. And I have half a dozen
      excursions in a neighborhood of twenty miles, in which I mean to show you
      what old England is, in a way that you would never find out for yourself.
      Do not speak of going. This day, if you find yourself strong enough, you
      shall go and look at an old village church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, accordingly, walking slowly, in consequence of Redclyffe&rsquo;s yet
      imperfect strength, along the highroad, which was overshadowed with elms,
      that grew in beautiful shape and luxuriance in that part of England, not
      with the slender, drooping, picturesque grace of a New England elm, but
      more luxuriant, fuller of leaves, sturdier in limb. It was a day which the
      Warden called fine, and which Redclyffe, at home, would have thought to
      bode rain; though here he had learned that such weather might continue for
      weeks together, with only a few raindrops all the time. The road was in
      the finest condition, hard and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not long emerged from the gateway of the Hospital,&mdash;at the
      venerable front and gables of which Redclyffe turned to look with a
      feeling as if it were his home,&mdash;when they heard the clatter of hoofs
      behind them, and a gentleman on horseback rode by, paying a courteous
      salute to the Warden as he passed. A groom in livery followed at a little
      distance, and both rode roundly towards the village, whither the Warden
      and his friend were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you observe that man?&rdquo; asked the Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;Is he an Englishman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pertinent question,&rdquo; replied the Warden, &ldquo;but I scarcely know
      how to answer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Redclyffe&rsquo;s question had been suggested by the appearance of the
      mounted gentleman, who was a dark, thin man, with black hair, and a black
      moustache and pointed beard setting off his sallow face, in which the eyes
      had a certain pointed steeliness, which did not look English,&mdash;whose
      eyes, methinks, are usually not so hard as those of Americans or
      foreigners. Redclyffe, somehow or other, had fancied that these not very
      pleasant eyes had been fixed in a marked way on himself, a stranger, while
      at the same time his salute was evidently directed towards the Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Englishman,&mdash;why, no,&rdquo; continued the latter. &ldquo;If you observe, he
      does not even sit his horse like an Englishman, but in that absurd, stiff
      continental way, as if a poker should get on horseback. Neither has he an
      English face, English manners, nor English religion, nor an English heart;
      nor, to sum up the whole, had he English birth. Nevertheless, as fate
      would have it, he is the inheritor of a good old English name, a fine
      patrimonial estate, and a very probable claim to an old English title.
      This is Lord Braithwaite of Braithwaite Hall, who if he can make his case
      good (and they say there is good prospect of it) will soon be Lord
      Hinchbrooke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know why, but I should be sorry for it,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;He
      certainly is not English; and I have an odd sort of sympathy, which makes
      me unwilling that English honors should be enjoyed by foreigners. This,
      then, is the gentleman of Italian birth whom you have mentioned to me, and
      of whom there is a slight mention in the County History.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;There have been three descents of this man&rsquo;s
      branch in Italy, and only one English mother in all that time. Positively,
      I do not see an English trait in his face, and as little in his manner.
      His civility is Italian, such as oftentimes, among his countrymen, has
      offered a cup of poison to a guest, or insinuated the stab of a stiletto
      into his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are particularly bitter against this poor man,&rdquo; said Redclyffe,
      laughing at the Warden&rsquo;s vehemence. &ldquo;His appearance&mdash;and yet he is a
      handsome man&mdash;is certainly not prepossessing; but unless it be
      countersigned by something in his actual life, I should hardly think it
      worth while to condemn him utterly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; you can forgive a little English prejudice,&rdquo; said the Warden,
      a little ashamed. &ldquo;But, in good earnest, the man has few or no good
      traits, takes no interest in the country, dislikes our sky, our earth, our
      people, is close and inhospitable, a hard landlord, and whatever may be
      his good qualities, they are not such as flourish in this soil and
      climate, or can be appreciated here.&rdquo; [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he children?&rdquo; asked Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say so,&mdash;a family by an Italian wife, whom some, on the other
      hand, pronounce to be no wife at all. His son is at a Catholic college in
      France; his daughter in a convent there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In talk like this they were drawing near the little rustic village of
      Braithwaite, and saw, above a cloud of foliage, the small, low,
      battlemented tower, the gray stones of which had probably been laid a
      little after the Norman conquest. Approaching nearer, they passed a
      thatched cottage or two, very plain and simple edifices, though
      interesting to Redclyffe from their antique aspect, which denoted that
      they were probably older than the settlement of his own country, and might
      very likely have nursed children who had gone, more than two centuries
      ago, to found the commonwealth of which he was a citizen. If you
      considered them in one way, prosaically, they were ugly enough; but then
      there were the old latticed windows, and there the thatch, which was
      verdant with leek, and strange weeds, possessing a whole botanical growth.
      And birds flew in and out, as if they had their homes there. Then came a
      row of similar cottages, all joined on together, and each with a little
      garden before it divided from its neighbors by a hedge, now in full
      verdure. Redclyffe was glad to see some symptoms of natural love of beauty
      here, for there were plants of box, cut into queer shapes of birds,
      peacocks, etc., as if year after year had been spent in bringing these
      vegetable sculptures to perfection. In one of the gardens, moreover, the
      ingenious inhabitant had spent his leisure in building grotto-work, of
      which the English are rather ludicrously fond, on their little bits of
      lawn, and in building a miniature castle of oyster-shells, where were seen
      turrets, ramparts, a frowning arched gateway, and miniature cannon looking
      from the embrasures. A pleasanter and better adornment were the homely
      household flowers, and a pleasant sound, too, was the hum of bees, who had
      their home in several beehives, and were making their honey among the
      flowers of the garden, or come from afar, buzzing dreamily through the
      air, laden with honey that they had found elsewhere. Fruit trees stood
      erect, or, in some instances, were flattened out against the walls of
      cottages, looking somewhat like hawks nailed <i>in terrorem</i> against a
      barn door. The male members of this little community were probably afield,
      with the exception of one or two half-torpid great-grandsires, who [were]
      moving rheumatically about the gardens, and some children not yet in
      breeches, who stared with stolid eyes at the passers-by; but the good
      dames were busy within doors, where Redclyffe had glimpses of their
      interior with its pavement of stone flags. Altogether it seemed a
      comfortable settlement enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that child yonder,&rdquo; observed the Warden, &ldquo;creeping away from
      the door, and displaying a vista of his petticoats as he does so? That
      sturdy boy is the lineal heir of one of the oldest families in this part
      of England,&mdash;though now decayed and fallen, as you may judge. So, you
      see, with all our contrivances to keep up an aristocracy, there still is
      change forever going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something not agreeable, and something otherwise, in the
      thought,&rdquo; replied Redclyffe. &ldquo;What is the name of the old family, whose
      representative is in such a case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moseby,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;Their family residence stood within three
      miles of Braithwaite Hall, but was taken down in the last century, and its
      place supplied by a grand show-place, built by a Birmingham manufacturer,
      who also originated here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They kept onward from this outskirt of the village, and soon, passing over
      a little rising ground, and descending now into a hollow came to the new
      portion of it, clustered around its gray Norman church, one side of the
      tower of which was covered with ivy, that was carefully kept, the Warden
      said, from climbing to the battlements, on account of some old prophecy
      that foretold that the tower would fall, if ever the ivy mantled over its
      top. Certainly, however, there seemed little likelihood that the square,
      low mass would fall, unless by external violence, in less than as many
      ages as it had already stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe looked at the old tower and little adjoining edifice with an
      interest that attached itself to every separate, moss-grown stone; but the
      Warden, like most Englishmen, was at once amazed and wearied with the
      American&rsquo;s enthusiasm for this spot, which to him was uninteresting for
      the very reason that made it most interesting to Redclyffe, because it had
      stood there such a weary while. It was too common an object to excite in
      his mind, as it did in Redclyffe&rsquo;s, visions of the long ago time when it
      was founded, when mass was first said there, and the glimmer of torches at
      the altar was seen through the vista of that broad-browed porch; and of
      all the procession of villagers that had since gone in and come out during
      nine hundred years, in their varying costume and fashion, but yet&mdash;and
      this was the strongest and most thrilling part of the idea&mdash;all, the
      very oldest of them, bearing a resemblance of feature, the kindred, the
      family likeness, to those who died yesterday,&mdash;to those who still
      went thither to worship; and that all the grassy and half-obliterated
      graves around had held those who bore the same traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the church was a little green, on which stood a very ancient
      yew tree, [Endnote: 2] all the heart of which seemed to have been eaten
      away by time, so that a man could now creep into the trunk, through a wide
      opening, and, looking upward, see another opening to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tree,&rdquo; observed the Warden, &ldquo;is well worth the notice of such an
      enthusiastic lover of old things; though I suppose aged trees may be the
      one antiquity that you do not value, having them by myriads in your
      primeval forests. But then the interest of this tree consists greatly in
      what your trees have not,&mdash;in its long connection with men and the
      goings of men. Some of its companions were made into bows for Harold&rsquo;s
      archers. This tree is of unreckonable antiquity; so old, that in a record
      of the time of Edward IV. it is styled the yew tree of Braithwaite Green.
      That carries it back to Norman times, truly. It was in comparatively
      modern times when it served as a gallows for one of James II.&lsquo;s
      bloodthirsty judges to hang his victims on after Monmouth&rsquo;s rebellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On one side of this yew was a certain structure which Redclyffe did not
      recognize as anything that he had before seen, but soon guessed its
      purpose; though, from appearances, it seemed to have been very long since
      it had served that purpose. It was a ponderous old oaken framework, six or
      seven feet high, so contrived that a heavy cross-piece shut down over
      another, leaving two round holes; in short, it was a pair of stocks, in
      which, I suppose, hundreds of vagrants and petty criminals had sat of old,
      but which now appeared to be merely a matter of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This excellent old machine,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;had been lying in a
      rubbish chamber of the church tower for at least a century; when the
      clerk, who is a little of an antiquarian, unearthed it, and I advised him
      to set it here, where it used to stand;&mdash;not with any idea of its
      being used (though there is as much need of it now as ever), but that the
      present age may see what comforts it has lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down a few moments on the circular seat, and looked at the pretty
      scene of this quiet little village, clustered round the old church as a
      centre; a collection of houses, mostly thatched, though there were one or
      two, with rather more pretension, that had roofs of red tiles. Some of
      them were stone cottages, whitewashed, but the larger edifices had timber
      frames, filled in with brick and plaster, which seemed to have been
      renewed in patches, and to be a frailer and less durable material than the
      old oak of their skeletons. They were gabled, with lattice windows, and
      picturesquely set off with projecting stones, and many little patchwork
      additions, such as, in the course of generations, the inhabitants had
      found themselves to need. There was not much commerce, apparently, in this
      little village, there seeming to be only one shop, with some gingerbread,
      penny whistles, ballads, and such matters, displayed in the window; and
      there, too, across the little green, opposite the church, was the village
      alehouse, with its bench under the low projecting eaves, with a Teniers
      scene of two wayfaring yeomen drinking a pot of beer and smoking their
      pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Redclyffe&rsquo;s Yankee feelings, there was something sad to think how the
      generations had succeeded one another, over and over, in innumerable
      succession, in this little spot, being born here, living, dying, lying
      down among their fathers&rsquo; dust, and forthwith getting up again, as it
      were, and recommencing the same meaningless round, and really bringing
      nothing to pass; for probably the generation of to-day, in so secluded and
      motionless a place as this, had few or no ideas in advance of their
      ancestors of five centuries ago. It seems not worth while that more than
      one generation of them should have existed. Even in dress, with their
      smock frocks and breeches, they were just like their fathers. The stirring
      blood of the new land,&mdash;where no man dwells in his father&rsquo;s house,&mdash;where
      no man thinks of dying in his birthplace,&mdash;awoke within him, and
      revolted at the thought; and, as connected with it, revolted at all the
      hereditary pretensions which, since his stay here, had exercised such an
      influence over the fanciful part of his nature. In another mood, the
      village might have seemed a picture of rural peace, which it would have
      been worth while to give up ambition to enjoy; now, as his warmer impulse
      stirred, it was a weariness to think of. The new American was stronger in
      him than the hereditary Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should go mad of it!&rdquo; exclaimed he aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started up impulsively, to the amazement of his companion, who of
      course could not comprehend what seemed so to have stung his American
      friend. As they passed the tree, on the other side of its huge trunk, they
      saw a young woman, sitting on that side of it, and sketching, apparently,
      the church tower, with the old Elizabethan vicarage that stood near it,
      with a gate opening into the churchyard, and much embowered and ivy-hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Cheltenham,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;I am glad to see that you have
      taken the old church in hand, for it is one of the prettiest rustic
      churches in England, and as well worthy as any to be engraved on a sheet
      of note-paper or put into a portfolio. Will you let my friend and me see
      your sketch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Warden had made his request with rather more freedom than perhaps he
      would to a lady whom he considered on a level with himself, though with
      perfect respect, that being considered; and Redclyffe, looking at the
      person, saw that it was the same of whose face he had had a glimpse in the
      looking-glass, in the old palmer&rsquo;s chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Doctor Hammond,&rdquo; said the young lady, with a respectful sort of
      frankness, &ldquo;you must excuse me. I am no good artist, and am but jotting
      down the old church because I like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, as you please,&rdquo; said the Warden; and whispered aside to
      Redclyffe, &ldquo;A girl&rsquo;s sketchbook is seldom worth looking at. But now, Miss
      Cheltenham, I am about to give my American friend here a lecture on
      gargoyles, and other peculiarities of sacred Gothic architecture; and if
      you will honor me with your attention, I should be glad to find my
      audience increased by one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the young lady arose, and Redclyffe, considering the Warden&rsquo;s allusion
      to him as a sort of partial introduction, bowed to her, and she responded
      with a cold, reserved, yet not unpleasant sort of courtesy. They went
      towards the church porch, and, looking in at the old stone bench on each
      side of the interior, the Warden showed them the hacks of the swords of
      the Roundheads, when they took it by storm. Redclyffe, mindful of the old
      graveyard on the edge of which he had spent his childhood, began to look
      at this far more antique receptacle, expecting to find there many ancient
      tombstones, perhaps of contemporaries or predecessors of the founders of
      his country. In this, however, he was disappointed, at least in a great
      measure; for the persons buried in the churchyard were probably, for the
      most part, of a humble rank in life, such as were not so ambitious as to
      desire a monument of any kind, but were content to let their low
      earth-mounds subside into the level, where their memory had waxed so faint
      that none among the survivors could point out the spot, or cared any
      longer about knowing it; while in other cases, where a monument of red
      freestone, or even of hewn granite, had been erected, the English climate
      had forthwith set to work to gnaw away the inscriptions; so that in fifty
      years&mdash;in a time that would have left an American tombstone as fresh
      as if just cut&mdash;it was quite impossible to make out the record. Their
      superiors, meanwhile, were sleeping less enviably in dismal mouldy and
      dusty vaults, instead of under the daisies. Thus Redclyffe really found
      less antiquity here, than in the graveyard which might almost be called
      his natal spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said something to this effect, the Warden nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and, in truth, we have not much need of inscriptions for
      these poor people. All good families&mdash;every one almost, with any
      pretensions to respectable station, has his family or individual
      recognition within the church, or upon its walls; or some of them you see
      on tombs on the outside. As for our poorer friends here, they are content,
      as they may well be, to swell and subside, like little billows of
      mortality, here on the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for my part,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;if there were anything particularly
      desirable on either side, I should like best to sleep under this lovely
      green turf, with the daisies strewn over me by Nature herself, and
      whatever other homely flowers any friend might choose to add.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Doctor Hammond,&rdquo; said the young woman, &ldquo;we see by this gravestone
      that sometimes a person of humble rank may happen to be commemorated, and
      that Nature&mdash;in this instance at least&mdash;seems to take especial
      pains and pleasure to preserve the record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She indicated a flat gravestone, near the porch, which time had indeed
      beautified in a singular way, for there was cut deep into it a name and
      date, in old English characters, very deep it must originally have been;
      and as if in despair of obliterating it, Time had taken the kindlier
      method of filling up the letters with moss; so that now, high embossed in
      loveliest green, was seen the name &ldquo;Richard Oglethorpe 1613&rdquo;;&mdash;green,
      and flourishing, and beautiful, like the memory of a good man. The
      inscription originally seemed to have contained some twenty lines, which
      might have been poetry, or perhaps a prose eulogy, or perhaps the simple
      record of the buried person&rsquo;s life; but all this, having been done in
      fainter and smaller letters, was now so far worn away as to be illegible;
      nor had they ever been deep enough to be made living in moss, like the
      rest of the inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How tantalizing,&rdquo; remarked Redclyffe, &ldquo;to see the verdant shine of this
      name, impressed upon us as something remarkable&mdash;and nothing else. I
      cannot but think that there must be something worth remembering about a
      man thus distinguished. When two hundred years have taken all these
      natural pains to illustrate and emblazon &lsquo;Richard Oglethorpe 1613.&rsquo; Ha! I
      surely recollect that name. It haunts me somehow, as if it had been
      familiar of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me,&rdquo; said the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an old name, hereabouts,&rdquo; observed the Warden, &ldquo;but has been long
      extinct,&mdash;a cottage name, not a gentleman&rsquo;s. I doubt not that
      Oglethorpes sleep in many of these undistinguished graves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe did not much attend to what his friend said, his attention being
      attracted to the tone&mdash;to something in the tone of the young lady,
      and also to her coincidence in his remark that the name appealed to some
      early recollection. He had been taxing his memory, to tell him when and
      how the name had become familiar to him; and he now remembered that it had
      occurred in the old Doctor&rsquo;s story of the Bloody Footstep, told to him and
      Elsie, so long ago. [Endnote: 3] To him and Elsie! It struck him&mdash;what
      if it were possible?&mdash;but he knew it was not&mdash;that the young
      lady had a remembrance also of the fact, and that she, after so many
      years, were mingling her thoughts with his. As this fancy recurred to him,
      he endeavored to get a glimpse of her face, and while he did so she turned
      it upon him. It was a quick, sensitive face, that did not seem altogether
      English; he would rather have imagined it American; but at all events he
      could not recognize it as one that he had seen before, and a thousand
      fantasies died within him as, in his momentary glance, he took in the
      volume of its contour.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the two friends had parted from the young lady, they passed through
      the village, and entered the park gate of Braithwaite Hall, pursuing a
      winding road through its beautiful scenery, which realized all that
      Redclyffe had read or dreamed about the perfect beauty of these sylvan
      creations, with the clumps of trees, or sylvan oaks, picturesquely
      disposed. To heighten the charm, they saw a herd of deer reposing, who, on
      their appearance, rose from their recumbent position, and began to gaze
      warily at the strangers; then, tossing their horns, they set off on a
      stampede, but only swept round, and settled down not far from where they
      were. Redclyffe looked with great interest at these deer, who were at once
      wild and civilized; retaining a kind of free forest citizenship, while yet
      they were in some sense subject to man. It seemed as if they were a link
      between wild nature and tame; as if they could look back, in their long
      recollections, through a vista, into the times when England&rsquo;s forests were
      as wild as those of America, though now they were but a degree more
      removed from domesticity than cattle, and took their food in winter from
      the hand of man, and in summer reposed upon his lawns. This seemed the
      last touch of that delightful conquered and regulated wildness, which
      English art has laid upon the whole growth of English nature, animal or
      vegetable.
    </p>

      &ldquo;There is nothing really wild in your whole island,&rdquo; he observed to the
      Warden. &ldquo;I have a sensation as if somebody knew, and had cultivated and
      fostered, and set out in its proper place, every tree that grows; as if
      somebody had patted the heads of your wildest animals and played with
      them. It is very delightful to me, for the present; and yet, I think, in
      the course of time, I should feel the need for something genuine, as it
      were,&mdash;something that had not the touch and breath of man upon it. I
      suppose even your skies are modified by the modes of human life that are
      going on beneath it. London skies, of course, are so; but the breath of a
      great people, to say nothing of its furnace vapors and hearth-smokes, make
      the sky other than it was a thousand years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe we English have a feeling like this occasionally,&rdquo; replied the
      Warden, &ldquo;and it is from that, partly, that we must account for our
      adventurousness into other regions, especially for our interest in what is
      wild and new. In your own forests, now, and prairies, I fancy we find a
      charm that Americans do not. In the sea, too, and therefore we are
      yachters. For my part, however, I have grown to like Nature a little
      smoothed down, and enriched; less gaunt and wolfish than she would be if
      left to herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I feel that charm too,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;But yet life would be slow
      and heavy, methinks, to see nothing but English parks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Continuing their course through the noble clumps of oaks, they by and by
      had a vista of the distant hall itself. It was one of the old English
      timber and plaster houses, many of which are of unknown antiquity; as was
      the case with a portion of this house, although other portions had been
      renewed, repaired, or added, within a century. It had, originally, the
      Warden said, stood all round an enclosed courtyard, like the great houses
      of the Continent; but now one side of the quadrangle had long been
      removed, and there was only a front, with two wings; the beams of old oak
      being picked out with black, and three or four gables in a line forming
      the front, while the wings seemed to be stone. It was the timber portion
      that was most ancient. A clock was on the midmost gable, and pointed now
      towards one o&rsquo;clock. The whole scene impressed Redclyffe, not as striking,
      but as an abode of ancient peace, where generation after generation of the
      same family had lived, each making the most of life, because the life of
      each successive dweller there was eked out with the lives of all who had
      hitherto lived there, and had in it equally those lives which were to come
      afterwards; so that there was a rare and successful contrivance for giving
      length, fulness, body, substance, to this thin and frail matter of human
      life. And, as life was so rich in comprehensiveness, the dwellers there
      made the most of it for the present and future, each generation contriving
      what it could to add to the cosiness, the comfortableness, the grave,
      solid respectability, the sylvan beauty, of the house with which they
      seemed to be connected both before and after death. The family had its
      home there; not merely the individual. Ancient shapes, that had apparently
      gone to the family tomb, had yet a right by family hearth and in family
      hall; nor did they come thither cold and shivering, and diffusing dim
      ghostly terrors, and repulsive shrinkings, and death in life; but in warm,
      genial attributes, making this life now passing more dense as it were, by
      adding all the substance of their own to it. Redclyffe could not compare
      this abode, and the feelings that it aroused, to the houses of his own
      country; poor tents of a day, inns of a night, where nothing was certain,
      save that the family of him who built it would not dwell here, even if he
      himself should have the bliss to die under the roof, which, with absurdest
      anticipations, he had built for his posterity. Posterity! An American can
      have none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this sort of thing is beautiful; the family institution was beautiful
      in its day,&rdquo; ejaculated he, aloud, to himself, not to his companion; &ldquo;but
      it is a thing of the past. It is dying out in England; and as for
      ourselves, we never had it. Something better will come up; but as for
      this, it is past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a sad thing to say,&rdquo; observed the Warden, by no means
      comprehending what was passing in his friend&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;But if you wish to
      view the interior of the Hall, we will go thither; for, harshly as I have
      spoken of the owner, I suppose he has English feeling enough to give us
      lunch and show us the old house of his forefathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present, if you please,&rdquo; replied Redclyffe. &ldquo;I am afraid of
      destroying my delightful visionary idea of the house by coming too near
      it. Before I leave this part of the country, I should be glad to ramble
      over the whole of it, but not just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Redclyffe was still enjoying the frank hospitality of his new
      friend, a rather marked event occurred in his life; yet not so important
      in reality as it seemed to his English friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large letter was delivered to him, bearing the official seal of the
      United States, and the indorsement of the State Department; a very
      important-looking document, which could not but add to the importance of
      the recipient in the eyes of any Englishman, accustomed as they are to bow
      down before any seal of government. Redclyffe opened it rather coolly,
      being rather loath to renew any of his political remembrances, now that he
      was in peace; or to think of the turmoil of modern and democratic
      politics, here in this quietude of gone-by ages and customs. The contents,
      however, took him by surprise; nor did he know whether to be pleased or
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official package, in short, contained an announcement that he had been
      appointed by the President, by and with the advice of the Senate, to one
      of the Continental missions, usually esteemed an object of considerable
      ambition to any young man in politics; so that, if consistent with his own
      pleasure, he was now one of the Diplomatic Corps, a Minister, and
      representative of his country. On first considering the matter, Redclyffe
      was inclined to doubt whether this honor had been obtained for him
      altogether by friendly aid, though it did happen to have much in it that
      might suit his half-formed purpose of remaining long abroad; but with an
      eye already rendered somewhat oblique by political practice, he suspected
      that a political rival&mdash;a rival, though of his own party&mdash;had
      been exerting himself to provide an inducement for Redclyffe to leave the
      local field to him; while he himself should take advantage of the vacant
      field, and his rival be thus insidiously, though honorably, laid on the
      shelf, whence if he should try to remove himself a few years hence the
      shifting influences of American politics would be likely enough to thwart
      him; so that, for the sake of being a few years nominally somebody, he
      might in fine come back to his own country and find himself permanently
      nobody. But Redclyffe had already sufficiently begun to suspect that he
      lacked some qualities that a politician ought to have, and without which a
      political life, whether successful or otherwise, is sure to be a most
      irksome one: some qualities he lacked, others he had, both almost equally
      an obstacle. When he communicated the offer, therefore, to his friend, the
      Warden, it was with the remark that he believed he should accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept it?&rdquo; cried the Warden, opening his eyes. &ldquo;I should think so,
      indeed! Why, it puts you above the level of the highest nobility of the
      Court to which you are accredited; simple republican as you are, it gives
      you rank with the old blood and birth of Europe. Accept it? By all means;
      and I will come and see you at your court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is more different between England and America,&rdquo; said Redclyffe,
      &ldquo;than the different way in which the citizen of either country looks at
      official station. To an Englishman, a commission, of whatever kind,
      emanating from his sovereign, brings apparently a gratifying sense of
      honor; to an American, on the contrary, it offers really nothing of the
      kind. He ceases to be a sovereign,&mdash;an atom of sovereignty, at all
      events,&mdash;and stoops to be a servant. If I accept this mission,
      honorable as you think it, I assure you I shall not feel myself quite the
      man I have hitherto been; although there is no obstacle in the way of
      party obligations or connections to my taking it, if I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not well understand this,&rdquo; quoth the good Warden. &ldquo;It is one of the
      promises of Scripture to the wise man, that he shall stand before kings,
      and that this embassy will enable you to do. No man&mdash;no man of your
      country surely&mdash;is more worthy to do so; so pray accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much as the Warden had seemed to affectionize Redclyffe hitherto, the
      latter could not but be sensible, thereafter, of a certain deference in
      his friend towards him, which he would fain have got rid of, had it been
      in his power. However, there was still the same heartiness under it all;
      and after a little he seemed, in some degree, to take Redclyffe&rsquo;s own view
      of the matter;&mdash;namely, that, being so temporary as these republican
      distinctions are, they really do not go skin deep, have no reality in
      them, and that the sterling quality of the man, be it higher or lower, is
      nowise altered by it;&mdash;an apothegm that is true even of an hereditary
      nobility, and still more so of our own Honorables and Excellencies.
      However, the good Warden was glad of his friend&rsquo;s dignity, and perhaps,
      too, a little glad that this high fortune had befallen one whom he chanced
      to be entertaining under his roof. As it happened, there was an
      opportunity which might be taken advantage of to celebrate the occasion;
      at least, to make it known to the English world so far as the extent of
      the county. [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an hereditary custom for the warden of Braithwaite Hospital, once a
      year, to give a grand dinner to the nobility and gentry of the
      neighborhood; and to this end a bequest had been made by one of the former
      squires or lords of Braithwaite which would of itself suffice to feed
      forty or fifty Englishmen with reasonable sumptuousness. The present
      Warden, being a gentleman of private fortune, was accustomed to eke the
      limited income, devoted for this purpose, with such additions from his own
      resources as brought the rude and hearty hospitality contemplated by the
      first founder on a par with modern refinements of gourmandism. The banquet
      was annually given in the fine old hall where James II. had feasted; and
      on some of these occasions the Warden&rsquo;s table had been honored with
      illustrious guests; especially when any of them happened to be wanting an
      opportunity to come before the public in an after-dinner speech. Just at
      present there was no occasion of that sort; and the good Warden fancied
      that he might give considerable <i>éclat</i> to his hereditary feast by
      bringing forward the young American envoy, a distinguished and eloquent
      man, to speak on the well-worn topic of the necessity of friendly
      relations between England and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are eloquent, I doubt not, my young friend?&rdquo; inquired he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; answered Redclyffe, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, I know it,&rdquo; returned the Warden. &ldquo;If one have all the natural
      prerequisites of eloquence; a quick sensibility, ready thought, apt
      expression, a good voice&mdash;and not making its way into the world
      through your nose either, as they say most of your countrymen&rsquo;s voices do.
      You shall make the crack speech at my dinner; and so strengthen the bonds
      of good fellowship between our two countries, that there shall be no
      question of war for at least six months to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the preparations for this stately banquet went on with great
      spirit; and the Warden exhorted Redclyffe to be thinking of some good
      topics for his international speech; but the young man laughed it off, and
      told his friend that he thought the inspiration of the moment, aided by
      the good old wine which the Warden had told him of, as among the treasures
      of the Hospital, would perhaps serve him better than any elaborate
      preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe, being not even yet strong, used to spend much time, when the
      day chanced to be pleasant, (which was oftener than his preconceptions of
      English weather led him to expect,) in the garden behind the Warden&rsquo;s
      house. It was an extensive one, and apparently as antique as the
      foundation of the establishment; and during all these years it had
      probably been growing richer and richer. Here were flowers of ancient
      race, and some that had been merely field or wayside flowers when first
      they came into the garden; but by long cultivation and hereditary care,
      instead of dying out, they had acquired a new richness and beauty, so that
      you would scarcely recognize the daisy or the violet. Roses too, there
      were, which Doctor Hammond said had been taken from those white and red
      rose-trees in the Temple Gardens, whence the partisans of York and
      Lancaster had plucked their fatal badges. With these, there were all the
      modern and far-fetched flowers from America, the East, and elsewhere; even
      the prairie flowers and the California blossoms were represented here; for
      one of the brethren had horticultural tastes, and was permitted freely to
      exercise them there. The antique character of the garden was preserved,
      likewise, by the alleys of box, a part of which had been suffered to
      remain, and was now grown to a great height and density, so as to make
      impervious green walls. There were also yew trees clipped into strange
      shapes of bird and beast, and uncouth heraldic figures, among which of
      course the leopard&rsquo;s head grinned triumphant; and as for fruit, the high
      garden wall was lined with pear trees, spread out flat against it, where
      they managed to produce a cold, flavorless fruit, a good deal akin to
      cucumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in these genial old arbors, Redclyffe used to recline in the sweet,
      mild summer weather, basking in the sun, which was seldom too warm to make
      its full embrace uncomfortable; and it seemed to him, with its fertility,
      with its marks everywhere of the quiet long-bestowed care of man, the
      sweetest and cosiest seclusion he had ever known; and two or three times a
      day, when he heard the screech of the railway train, rushing on towards
      distant London, it impressed him still more with a sense of safe repose
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not unfrequently he here met the white-bearded palmer in whose chamber he
      had found himself, as if conveyed thither by enchantment, when he first
      came to the Hospital. The old man was not by any means of the garrulous
      order; and yet he seemed full of thoughts, full of reminiscences, and not
      disinclined to the company of Redclyffe. In fact, the latter sometimes
      flattered himself that a tendency for his society was one of the motives
      that brought him to the garden; though the amount of their intercourse,
      after all, was not so great as to warrant the idea of any settled purpose
      in so doing. Nevertheless, they talked considerably; and Redclyffe could
      easily see that the old man had been an extensive traveller, and had
      perhaps occupied situations far different from his present one, and had
      perhaps been a struggler in troubled waters before he was drifted into the
      retirement where Redclyffe found him. He was fond of talking about the
      unsuspected relationship that must now be existing between many families
      in England and unknown consanguinity in the new world, where, perhaps,
      really the main stock of the family tree was now existing, and with a new
      spirit and life, which the representative growth here in England had lost
      by too long continuance in one air and one mode of life. For history and
      observation proved that all people&mdash;and the English people by no
      means less than others&mdash;needed to be transplanted, or somehow
      renewed, every few generations; so that, according to this ancient
      philosopher&rsquo;s theory, it would be good for the whole people of England
      now, if it could at once be transported to America, where its fatness, its
      sleepiness, its too great beefiness, its preponderant animal character,
      would be rectified by a different air and soil; and equally good, on the
      other hand, for the whole American people to be transplanted back to the
      original island, where their nervousness might be weighted with heavier
      influences, where their little women might grow bigger, where their thin,
      dry men might get a burden of flesh and good stomachs, where their
      children might, with the air, draw in a reverence for age, forms, and
      usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe listened with complacency to these speculations, smiling at the
      thought of such an exodus as would take place, and the reciprocal
      dissatisfaction which would probably be the result. But he had greater
      pleasure in drawing out some of the old gentleman&rsquo;s legendary lore, some
      of which, whether true or not, was very curious. [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      As Redclyffe sat one day watching the old man in the garden, he could not
      help being struck by the scrupulous care with which he attended to the
      plants; it seemed to him that there was a sense of justice,&mdash;of
      desiring to do exactly what was right in the matter, not favoring one
      plant more than another, and doing all he could for each. His progress, in
      consequence, was so slow, that in an hour, while Redclyffe was off and on
      looking at him, he had scarcely done anything perceptible. Then he was so
      minute; and often, when he was on the point of leaving one thing to take
      up another, some small neglect that he saw or fancied called him back
      again, to spend other minutes on the same task. He was so full of
      scruples. It struck Redclyffe that this was conscience, morbid, sick, a
      despot in trifles, looking so closely into life that it permitted nothing
      to be done. The man might once have been strong and able, but by some
      unhealthy process of his life he had ceased to be so now. Nor did any
      happy or satisfactory result appear to come from these painfully wrought
      efforts; he still seemed to know that he had left something undone in
      doing too much in another direction. Here was a lily that had been
      neglected, while he paid too much attention to a rose; he had set his foot
      on a violet; he had grubbed up, in his haste, a little plant that he
      mistook for a weed, but that he now suspected was an herb of grace.
      Grieved by such reflections as these, he heaved a deep sigh, almost
      amounting to a groan, and sat down on the little stool that he carried
      with him in his weeding, resting his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe deemed that he might be doing the old man a good service by
      interrupting his melancholy labors; so he emerged from the opposite door
      of the summer-house, and came along the adjoining walk with somewhat heavy
      footsteps, in order that the palmer might have warning of his approach
      without any grounds to suppose that he had been watched hitherto.
      Accordingly, when he turned into the other alley, he found the old man
      sitting erect on his stool, looking composed, but still sad, as was his
      general custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all your wanderings and experience,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I observe that you
      come back to the original occupation of cultivating a garden,&mdash;the
      innocentest of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so it would seem,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;but somehow or other I do not
      find peace in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These plants and shrubs,&rdquo; returned Redclyffe, &ldquo;seem at all events to
      recognize the goodness of your rule, so far as it has extended over them.
      See how joyfully they take the sun; how clear [they are] from all these
      vices that lie scattered round, in the shape of weeds. It is a lovely
      sight, and I could almost fancy a quiet enjoyment in the plants
      themselves, which they have no way of making us aware of, except by giving
      out a fragrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how infinitely would that idea increase man&rsquo;s responsibility,&rdquo; said
      the old palmer, &ldquo;if, besides man and beast, we should find it necessary to
      believe that there is also another set of beings dependent for their
      happiness on our doing, or leaving undone, what might have effect on
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I question,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, smiling, &ldquo;whether their pleasurable or
      painful experiences can be so keen, that we need trouble our consciences
      much with regard to what we do, merely as it affects them. So highly
      cultivated a conscience as that would be a nuisance to one&rsquo;s self and
      one&rsquo;s fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say a terrible thing,&rdquo; rejoined the old man. &ldquo;Can conscience be too
      much alive in us? is not everything however trifling it seems, an item in
      the great account, which it is of infinite importance therefore to have
      right? A terrible thing is that you have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Redclyffe; &ldquo;but it is none the less certain to me,
      that the efficient actors&mdash;those who mould the world&mdash;are the
      persons in whom something else is developed more strongly than conscience.
      There must be an invincible determination to effect something; it may be
      set to work in the right direction, but after that it must go onward,
      trampling down small obstacles&mdash;small considerations of right and
      wrong&mdash;as a great rock, thundering down a hillside, crushes a
      thousand sweet flowers, and ploughs deep furrows in the innocent
      hillside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Redclyffe gave vent to this doctrine, which was not naturally his, but
      which had been the inculcation of a life, hitherto devoted to politics, he
      was surprised to find how strongly sensible he became of the ugliness and
      indefensibleness of what he said. He felt as if he were speaking under the
      eye of Omniscience, and as if every word he said were weighed, and its
      emptiness detected, by an unfailing intelligence. He had thought that he
      had volumes to say about the necessity of consenting not to do right in
      all matters minutely, for the sake of getting out an available and
      valuable right as the whole; but there was something that seemed to tie
      his tongue. Could it be the quiet gaze of this old man, so unpretending,
      so humble, so simple in aspect? He could not tell, only that he faltered,
      and finally left his speech in the midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was surprised to find how he had to struggle against a certain
      repulsion within himself to the old man. He seemed so nonsensical,
      interfering with everybody&rsquo;s right in the world; so mischievous, standing
      there and shutting out the possibility of action. It seemed well to
      trample him down; to put him out of the way&mdash;no matter how&mdash;somehow.
      It gave him, he thought, an inkling of the way in which this poor old man
      had made himself odious to his kind, by opposing himself, inevitably, to
      what was bad in man, chiding it by his very presence, accepting nothing
      false. You must either love him utterly, or hate him utterly; for he could
      not let you alone. Redclyffe, being a susceptible man, felt this influence
      in the strongest way; for it was as if there was a battle within him, one
      party pulling, wrenching him towards the old man, another wrenching him
      away, so that, by the agony of the contest, he felt disposed to end it by
      taking flight, and never seeing the strange individual again. He could
      well enough conceive how a brutal nature, if capable of receiving his
      influence at all, might find it so intolerable that it must needs get rid
      of him by violence,&mdash;by taking his blood if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these feelings were but transitory, however; they swept across him
      like a wind, and then he looked again at the old man and saw only his
      simplicity, his unworldliness,&mdash;saw little more than the worn and
      feeble individual in the Hospital garb, leaning on his staff; and then
      turning again with a gentle sigh to weed in the garden. And then Redclyffe
      went away, in a state of disturbance for which he could not account to
      himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      High up in the old carved roof, meanwhile, the spiders of centuries still
      hung their flaunting webs with a profusion that old Doctor Grimshawe would
      have been ravished to see; but even this was to be remedied, for one day,
      on looking in, Redclyffe found the great hall dim with floating dust, and
      down through it came great floating masses of cobweb, out of which the old
      Doctor would have undertaken to regenerate the world; and he saw, dimly
      aloft, men on ladders sweeping away these accumulations of years, and
      breaking up the haunts and residences of hereditary spiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stately old hall had been in process of cleaning and adapting to the
      banquet purposes of the nineteenth century, which it was accustomed to
      subserve, in so proud a way, in the sixteenth. It was, in the first place,
      well swept and cleansed; the painted glass windows were cleansed from
      dust, and several panes, which had been unfortunately broken and filled
      with common glass, were filled in with colored panes, which the Warden had
      picked up somewhere in his antiquarian researches. They were not, to be
      sure, just what was wanted; a piece of a saint, from some cathedral
      window, supplying what was lacking of the gorgeous purple of a mediæval
      king; but the general effect was rich and good, whenever the misty English
      atmosphere supplied sunshine bright enough to pervade it. Tapestry, too,
      from antique looms, faded, but still gorgeous, was hung upon the walls.
      Some suits of armor, that hung beneath the festal gallery, were polished
      till the old battered helmets and pierced breastplates sent a gleam like
      that with which they had flashed across the battle-fields of old.
      [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      So now the great day of the Warden&rsquo;s dinner had arrived; and, as may be
      supposed, there were fiery times in the venerable old kitchen. The cook,
      according to ancient custom, concocted many antique dishes, such as used
      to be set before kings and nobles; dainties that might have called the
      dead out of their graves; combinations of ingredients that had ceased to
      be put together for centuries; historic dishes, which had long, long
      ceased to be in the list of revels. Then there was the stalwart English
      cheer of the sirloin, and the round; there were the vast plum-puddings,
      the juicy mutton, the venison; there was the game, now just in season,&mdash;the
      half-tame wild fowl of English covers, the half-domesticated wild deer of
      English parks, the heathcock from the far-off hills of Scotland, and one
      little prairie hen, and some canvas-back ducks&mdash;obtained, Heaven
      knows how, in compliment to Redclyffe&mdash;from his native shores. O, the
      old jolly kitchen! how rich the flavored smoke that went up its vast
      chimney! how inestimable the atmosphere of steam that was diffused through
      it! How did the old men peep into it, even venture across the threshold,
      braving the hot wrath of the cook and his assistants, for the sake of
      imbuing themselves with these rich and delicate flavors, receiving them in
      as it were spiritually; for, received through the breath and in the
      atmosphere, it was really a spiritual enjoyment. The ghosts of ancient
      epicures seemed, on that day and the few preceding ones, to haunt the dim
      passages, snuffing in with shadowy nostrils the rich vapors, assuming
      visibility in the congenial medium, almost becoming earthly again in the
      strength of their earthly longings for one other feast such as they used
      to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it to be supposed that it was only these antique dainties that the
      Warden provided for his feast. No; if the cook, the cultured and recondite
      old cook, who had accumulated within himself all that his predecessors
      knew for centuries,&mdash;if he lacked anything of modern fashion and
      improvement, he had supplied his defect by temporary assistance from a
      London club; and the bill of fare was provided with dishes that Soyer
      would not have harshly criticised. The ethereal delicacy of modern taste,
      the nice adjustment of flowers, the French style of cookery, was richly
      attended to; and the list was long of dishes with fantastic names, fish,
      fowl, and flesh; and <i>entremets</i>, and &ldquo;sweets,&rdquo; as the English call
      them, and sugared cates, too numerous to think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wines we will not take upon ourselves to enumerate; but the juice,
      then destined to be quaffed, was in part the precious vintages that had
      been broached half a century ago, and had been ripening ever since; the
      rich and dry old port, so unlovely to the natural palate that it requires
      long English seasoning to get it down; the sherry, imported before these
      modern days of adulteration; some claret, the Warden said of rarest
      vintage; some Burgundy, of which it was the quality to warm the blood and
      genialize existence for three days after it was drunk. Then there was a
      rich liquid contributed to this department by Redclyffe himself; for, some
      weeks since, when the banquet first loomed in the distance, he had
      (anxious to evince his sense of the Warden&rsquo;s kindness) sent across the
      ocean for some famous Madeira which he had inherited from the Doctor, and
      never tasted yet. This, together with some of the Western wines of
      America, had arrived, and was ready to be broached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Warden tested these modern wines, and recognized a new flavor, but
      gave it only a moderate approbation; for, in truth, an elderly Englishman
      has not a wide appreciation of wines, nor loves new things in this kind
      more than in literature or life. But he tasted the Madeira, too, and
      underwent an ecstasy, which was only alleviated by the dread of gout,
      which he had an idea that this wine must bring on,&mdash;and truly, if it
      were so splendid a wine as he pronounced it, some pain ought to follow as
      the shadow of such a pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was a festival of antique date, the dinner hour had been fixed
      earlier than is usual at such stately banquets; namely, at six o&rsquo;clock,
      which was long before the dusky hour at which Englishmen love best to
      dine. About that period, the carriages drove into the old courtyard of the
      Hospital in great abundance; blocking up, too, the ancient portal, and
      remaining in a line outside. Carriages they were with armorial bearings,
      family coaches in which came Englishmen in their black coats and white
      neckcloths, elderly, white-headed, fresh-colored, squat; not beautiful,
      certainly, nor particularly dignified, nor very well dressed, nor with
      much of an imposing air, but yet, somehow or other, producing an effect of
      force, respectability, reliableness, trust, which is probably deserved,
      since it is invariably experienced. Cold they were in deportment, and
      looked coldly on the stranger, who, on his part, drew himself up with an
      extra haughtiness and reserve, and felt himself in the midst of his
      enemies, and more as if he were going to do battle than to sit down to a
      friendly banquet. The Warden introduced him, as an American diplomatist,
      to one or two of the gentlemen, who regarded him forbiddingly, as
      Englishmen do before dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after Redclyffe had entered the reception-room, which was but
      shortly before the hour appointed for the dinner, there was another
      arrival betokened by the clatter of hoofs and grinding wheels in the
      courtyard; and then entered a gentleman of different mien from the bluff,
      ruddy, simple-minded, yet worldly Englishmen around him. He was a tall,
      dark man, with a black moustache and almost olive skin, a slender, lithe
      figure, a flexible face, quick, flashing, mobile. His deportment was
      graceful; his dress, though it seemed to differ in little or nothing from
      that of the gentlemen in the room, had yet a grace and picturesqueness in
      his mode of wearing it. He advanced to the Warden, who received him with
      distinction, and yet, Redclyffe fancied, not exactly with cordiality. It
      seemed to Redclyffe that the Warden looked round, as if with the purpose
      of presenting Redclyffe to this gentleman, but he himself, from some
      latent reluctance, had turned away and entered, into conversation with one
      of the other gentlemen, who said now, looking at the new-comer, &ldquo;Are you
      acquainted with this last arrival?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;I know Lord Braithwaite by sight, indeed,
      but have had no introduction. He is a man, certainly, of distinguished
      appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, pretty well,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;but un-English, as also are his
      manners. It is a pity to see an old English family represented by such a
      person. Neither he, his father, nor grandfather was born among us; he has
      far more Italian blood than enough to drown the slender stream of
      Anglo-Saxon and Norman. His modes of life, his prejudices, his estates,
      his religion, are unlike our own; and yet here he is in the position of an
      old English gentleman, possibly to be a peer. You, whose nationality
      embraces that of all the world, cannot, I suppose, understand this English
      feeling.&rdquo; [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;I can perfectly understand it. An American,
      in his feelings towards England, has all the jealousy and exclusiveness of
      Englishmen themselves,&mdash;perhaps, indeed, a little exaggerated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the Englishman, incredulously, &ldquo;I think you
      cannot possibly understand it!&rdquo; [Endnote: 3.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were by this time all assembled, and at the Warden&rsquo;s bidding
      they moved from the reception-room to the dining-hall, in some order and
      precedence, of which Redclyffe could not exactly discover the principle,
      though he found that to himself&mdash;in his quality, doubtless, of
      Ambassador&mdash;there was assigned a pretty high place. A venerable
      dignitary of the Church&mdash;a dean, he seemed to be&mdash;having asked a
      blessing, the fair scene of the banquet now lay before the guests,
      presenting a splendid spectacle, in the high-walled, antique, tapestried
      hall, overhung with the dark, intricate oaken beams, with the high Gothic
      windows, through one of which the setting sunbeams streamed, and showed
      the figures of kings and warriors, and the old Braithwaites among them.
      Beneath and adown the hall extended the long line of the tables, covered
      with the snow of the damask tablecloth, on which glittered, gleamed, and
      shone a good quality of ancient ancestral plate, and an <i>épergne</i> of
      silver, extending down the middle; also the gleam of golden wine in the
      decanters; and truly Redclyffe thought that it was a noble spectacle, made
      so by old and stately associations, which made a noble banquet of what
      otherwise would be only a vulgar dinner. The English have this advantage
      and know how to make use of it. They bring&mdash;in these old,
      time-honored feasts&mdash;all the past to sit down and take the stately
      refreshment along with them, and they pledge the historic characters in
      their wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      A printed bill of fare, in gold letters, lay by each plate, on which
      Redclyffe saw the company glancing with great interest. The first dish, of
      course, was turtle soup, of which&mdash;as the gentleman next him, the
      Mayor of a neighboring town, told Redclyffe&mdash;it was allowable to take
      twice. This was accompanied, according to one of those rules which one
      knows not whether they are arbitrary or founded on some deep reason, by a
      glass of punch. Then came the noble turbot, the salmon, the sole, and
      divers of fishes, and the dinner fairly set in. The genial Warden seemed
      to have given liberal orders to the attendants, for they spared not to
      offer hock, champagne, sherry, to the guests, and good bitter ale, foaming
      in the goblet; and so the stately banquet went on, with somewhat tedious
      magnificence; and yet with a fulness of effect and thoroughness of sombre
      life that made Redclyffe feel that, so much importance being assigned to
      it,&mdash;it being so much believed in,&mdash;it was indeed a feast. The
      cumbrous courses swept by, one after another; and Redclyffe, finding it
      heavy work, sat idle most of the time, regarding the hall, the old
      decaying beams, the armor hanging beneath the galleries, and these
      Englishmen feasting where their fathers had feasted for so many ages, the
      same occasion, the same men, probably, in appearance, though the black
      coat and the white neckcloth had taken the place of ruff, embroidered
      doublet, and the magnificence of other ages. After all, the English have
      not such good things to eat as we in America, and certainly do not know
      better how to make them palatable. [Endnote: 4.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Well; but by and by the dinner came to a conclusion, as regarded the
      eating part; the cloth was withdrawn; a dessert of fruits, fresh and
      dried, pines, hothouse grapes, and all candied conserves of the Indies,
      was put on the long extent of polished mahogany. There was a tuning up of
      musicians, an interrogative drawing of fiddle-bows, and other musical
      twangs and puffs; the decanters opposite the Warden and his
      vice-president,&mdash;sherry, port, Redclyffe&rsquo;s Madeira, and claret, were
      put in motion along the table, and the guests filled their glasses for the
      toast which, at English dinner-tables, is of course the first to be
      honored,&mdash;the Queen. Then the band struck up the good old anthem,
      &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo; which the whole company rose to their feet to sing.
      It was a spectacle both interesting and a little ludicrous to Redclyffe,&mdash;being
      so apart from an American&rsquo;s sympathies, so unlike anything that he has in
      his life or possibilities,&mdash;this active and warm sentiment of
      loyalty, in which love of country centres, and assimilates, and transforms
      itself into a passionate affection for a person, in whom they love all
      their institutions. To say the truth, it seemed a happy notion; nor could
      the American&mdash;while he comforted himself in the pride of his
      democracy, and that he himself was a sovereign&mdash;could he help envying
      it a little, this childlike love and reverence for a person embodying all
      their country, their past, their earthly future. He felt that it might be
      delightful to have a sovereign, provided that sovereign were always a
      woman,&mdash;and perhaps a young and fine one. But, indeed, this is not
      the difficulty, methinks, in English institutions which the American finds
      it hardest to deal with. We could endure a born sovereign, especially if
      made such a mere pageant as the English make of theirs. What we find it
      hardest to conceive of is, the satisfaction with which Englishmen think of
      a race above them, with privileges that they cannot share, entitled to
      condescend to them, and to have gracious and beautiful manners at their
      expense; to be kind, simple, unpretending, because these qualities are
      more available than haughtiness; to be specimens of perfect manhood;&mdash;all
      these advantages in consequence of their position. If the peerage were a
      mere name, it would be nothing to envy; but it is so much more than a
      name; it enables men to be really so superior. The poor, the lower
      classes, might bear this well enough; but the classes that come next to
      the nobility,&mdash;the upper middle classes,&mdash;how they bear it so
      lovingly is what must puzzle the American. But probably the advantage of
      the peerage is the less perceptible the nearer it is looked at.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that Redclyffe, as he looked at this assembly of
      peers and gentlemen, thought with some self-gratulation of the probability
      that he had within his power as old a rank, as desirable a station, as the
      best of them; and that if he were restrained from taking it, it would
      probably only be by the democratic pride that made him feel that he could
      not, retaining all his manly sensibility, accept this gewgaw on which the
      ages&mdash;his own country especially&mdash;had passed judgment, while it
      had been suspended over his head. He felt himself, at any rate, in a
      higher position, having the option of taking this rank, and forbearing to
      do so, than if he took it. [Endnote: 5.]
    </p>
    <p>
      After this ensued a ceremony which is of antique date in old English
      corporations and institutions, at their high festivals. It is called the
      Loving Cup. A sort of herald or toast-master behind the Warden&rsquo;s chair
      made proclamation, reciting the names of the principal guests, and
      announcing to them, &ldquo;The Warden of the Braithwaite Hospital drinks to you
      in a Loving Cup&rdquo;; of which cup, having sipped, or seemed to sip (for
      Redclyffe observed that the old drinkers were rather shy of it) a small
      quantity, he sent it down the table. Its progress was accompanied with a
      peculiar entanglement of ceremony, one guest standing up while another
      drinks, being pretty much as follows. First, each guest receiving it
      covered from the next above him, the same took from the silver cup its
      silver cover; the guest drank with a bow to the Warden and company, took
      the cover from the preceding guest, covered the cup, handed it to the next
      below him, then again removed the cover, replaced it after the guest had
      drunk, who, on his part, went through the same ceremony. And thus the cup
      went slowly on its way down the stately hall; these ceremonies being, it
      is said, originally precautions against the risk, in wild times, of being
      stabbed by the man who was drinking with you, or poisoned by one who
      should fail to be your taster. The cup was a fine, ancient piece of plate,
      massive, heavy, curiously wrought with armorial bearings, in which the
      leopard&rsquo;s head appeared. Its contents, so far as Redclyffe could analyze
      them by a moderate sip, appeared to be claret, sweetened, with spices,
      and, however suited to the peculiarity of antique palates, was not greatly
      to Redclyffe&rsquo;s taste. [Endnote: 6.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe&rsquo;s companion just below him, while the Loving Cup was beginning
      its march, had been explaining the origin of the custom as a defence of
      the drinker in times of deadly feud; when it had reached Lord Braithwaite,
      who drank and passed it to Redclyffe covered, and with the usual bow,
      Redclyffe looked into his Lordship&rsquo;s Italian eyes and dark face as he did
      so, and the thought struck him, that, if there could possibly be any use
      in keeping up this old custom, it might be so now; for, how intimated he
      could hardly tell, he was sensible in his deepest self of a deadly
      hostility in this dark, courteous, handsome face. He kept his eyes fixed
      on his Lordship as he received the cup, and felt that in his own glance
      there was an acknowledgment of the enmity that he perceived, and a
      defiance, expressed without visible sign, and felt in the bow with which
      they greeted one another. When they had both resumed their seats,
      Redclyffe chose to make this ceremonial intercourse the occasion of again
      addressing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not whether your Lordship is more accustomed than myself to these
      stately ceremonials,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite, whose English was very good. &ldquo;But this is a
      good old ceremony, and an ingenious one; for does it not twine us into
      knotted links of love&mdash;this Loving Cup&mdash;like a wreath of
      Bacchanals whom I have seen surrounding an antique vase. Doubtless it has
      great efficacy in entwining a company of friendly guests into one
      affectionate society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it should seem so,&rdquo; replied Redclyffe, with a smile, and again
      meeting those black eyes, which smiled back on him. &ldquo;It should seem so,
      but it appears that the origin of the custom was quite different, and that
      it was as a safeguard to a man when he drank with his enemy. What a
      peculiar flavor it must have given to the liquor, when the eyes of two
      deadly foes met over the brim of the Loving Cup, and the drinker knew
      that, if he withdrew it, a dagger would be in his heart, and the other
      watched him drink, to see if it was poison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; responded his Lordship, &ldquo;they had strange fashions in those rough
      old times. Nowadays, we neither stab, shoot, nor poison. I scarcely think
      we hate except as interest guides us, without malevolence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This singular conversation was interrupted by a toast, and the rising of
      one of the guests to answer it. Several other toasts of routine succeeded;
      one of which, being to the honor of the old founder of the Hospital, Lord
      Braithwaite, as his representative, rose to reply,&mdash;which he did in
      good phrases, in a sort of eloquence unlike that of the Englishmen around
      him, and, sooth to say, comparatively unaccustomed as he must have been to
      the use of the language, much more handsomely than they. In truth,
      Redclyffe was struck and amused with the rudeness, the slovenliness, the
      inartistic quality of the English speakers, who rather seemed to avoid
      grace and neatness of set purpose, as if they would be ashamed of it.
      Nothing could be more ragged than these utterances which they called
      speeches; so patched, and darned; and yet, somehow or other&mdash;though
      dull and heavy as all which seemed to inspire them&mdash;they had a kind
      of force. Each man seemed to have the faculty of getting, after some rude
      fashion, at the sense and feeling that was in him; and without glibness,
      without smoothness, without form or comeliness, still the object with
      which each one rose to speak was accomplished,&mdash;and what was more
      remarkable, it seemed to be accomplished without the speaker&rsquo;s having any
      particular plan for doing it. He was surprised, too, to observe how
      loyally every man seemed to think himself bound to speak, and rose to do
      his best, however unfit his usual habits made him for the task. Observing
      this, and thinking how many an American would be taken aback and
      dumbfounded by being called on for a dinner speech, he could not but doubt
      the correctness of the general opinion, that Englishmen are naturally less
      facile of public speech than our countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surpass your countrymen,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, when his Lordship resumed
      his seat, amid rapping and loud applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My countrymen? I scarcely know whether you mean the English or Italians,&rdquo;
       said Lord Braithwaite. &ldquo;Like yourself, I am a hybrid, with really no
      country, and ready to take up with any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a country,&mdash;one which I am little inclined to deny,&rdquo; replied
      Redclyffe, gravely, while a flush (perhaps of conscientious shame) rose to
      his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship bowed, with a dark Italian smile, but Redclyffe&rsquo;s attention
      was drawn away from the conversation by a toast which the Warden now rose
      to give, and in which he found himself mainly concerned. With a little
      preface of kind words (not particularly aptly applied) to the great and
      kindred country beyond the Atlantic, the worthy Warden proceeded to remark
      that his board was honored, on this high festival, with a guest from that
      new world; a gentleman yet young, but already distinguished in the
      councils of his country; the bearer, he remarked, of an honored English
      name, which might well claim to be remembered here, and on this occasion,
      although he had understood from his friend that the American bearers of
      this name did not count kindred with the English ones. This gentleman, he
      further observed, with considerable flourish and emphasis, had recently
      been called from his retirement and wanderings into the diplomatic service
      of his country, which he would say, from his knowledge, the gentleman was
      well calculated to honor. He drank the health of the Honorable Edward
      Redclyffe, Ambassador of the United States to the Court of Hohen-Linden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our English cousins received this toast with the kindest enthusiasm, as
      they always do any such allusion to our country; it being a festal
      feeling, not to be used except on holidays. They rose, with glass in hand,
      in honor of the Ambassador; the band struck up &ldquo;Hail, Columbia&rdquo;; and our
      hero marshalled his thoughts as well as he might for the necessary
      response; and when the tumult subsided he arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      His quick apprehending had taught him something of the difference of taste
      between an English and an American audience at a dinner-table; he felt
      that there must be a certain looseness, and carelessness, and roughness,
      and yet a certain restraint; that he must not seem to aim at speaking
      well, although, for his own ambition, he was not content to speak ill;
      that, somehow or other, he must get a heartiness into his speech; that he
      must not polish, nor be too neat, and must come with a certain rudeness to
      his good points, as if he blundered on them, and were surprised into them.
      Above all, he must let the good wine and cheer, and all that he knew and
      really felt of English hospitality, as represented by the kind Warden, do
      its work upon his heart, and speak up to the extent of what he felt&mdash;and
      if a little more, then no great harm&mdash;about his own love for the
      father-land, and the broader grounds of the relations between the two
      countries. On this system, Redclyffe began to speak; and being naturally
      and habitually eloquent, and of mobile and ready sensibilities, he
      succeeded, between art and nature, in making a speech that absolutely
      delighted the company, who made the old hall echo, and the banners wave
      and tremble, and the board shake, and the glasses jingle, with their
      rapturous applause. What he said&mdash;or some shadow of it, and more than
      he quite liked to own&mdash;was reported in the county paper that gave a
      report of the dinner; but on glancing over it, it seems not worth while to
      produce this eloquent effort in our pages, the occasion and topics being
      of merely temporary interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe sat down, and sipped his claret, feeling a little ashamed of
      himself, as people are apt to do after a display of this kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the way to the English heart better than I do,&rdquo; remarked his
      Lordship, after a polite compliment to the speech. &ldquo;Methinks these dull
      English are being improved in your atmosphere. The English need a change
      every few centuries,&mdash;either by immigration of new stock, or
      transportation of the old,&mdash;or else they grow too gross and earthly,
      with their beef, mutton, and ale. I think, now, it might benefit both
      countries, if your New England population were to be reciprocally
      exchanged with an equal number of Englishmen. Indeed, Italians might do as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should regret,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;to change the English, heavy as they
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an admirable Englishman,&rdquo; said his Lordship. &ldquo;For my part, I
      cannot say that the people are very much to my taste, any more than their
      skies and climate, in which I have shivered during the two years that I
      have spent here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here their conversation ceased; and Redclyffe listened to a long train of
      speechifying, in the course of which everybody, almost, was toasted;
      everybody present, at all events, and many absent. The Warden&rsquo;s old wine
      was not spared; the music rang and resounded from the gallery; and
      everybody seemed to consider it a model feast, although there were no very
      vivid signs of satisfaction, but a decorous, heavy enjoyment, a dull red
      heat of pleasure, without flame. Soda and seltzer-water, and coffee, by
      and by were circulated; and at a late hour the company began to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before taking his departure, Lord Braithwaite resumed his conversation
      with Redclyffe, and, as it appeared, with the purpose of making a
      hospitable proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live very much alone,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;being insulated from my neighbors by
      many circumstances,&mdash;habits, religion, and everything else peculiarly
      English. If you are curious about old English modes of life, I can show
      you, at least, an English residence, little altered within a century past.
      Pray come and spend a week with me before you leave this part of the
      country. Besides, I know the court to which you are accredited, and can
      give you, perhaps, useful information about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe looked at him in some surprise, and with a nameless hesitation;
      for he did not like his Lordship, and had fancied, in truth, that there
      was a reciprocal antipathy. Nor did he yet feel that he was mistaken in
      this respect; although his Lordship&rsquo;s invitation was given in a tone of
      frankness, and seemed to have no reserve, except that his eyes did not
      meet his like Anglo-Saxon eyes, and there seemed an Italian looking out
      from within the man. But Redclyffe had a sort of repulsion within himself;
      and he questioned whether it would be fair to his proposed host to accept
      his hospitality, while he had this secret feeling of hostility and
      repugnance,&mdash;which might be well enough accounted for by the
      knowledge that he secretly entertained hostile interests to their race,
      and half a purpose of putting them in force. And, besides this,&mdash;although
      Redclyffe was ashamed of the feeling,&mdash;he had a secret dread, a
      feeling that it was not just a safe thing to trust himself in this man&rsquo;s
      power; for he had a sense, sure as death, that he did not wish him well,
      and had a secret dread of the American. But he laughed within himself at
      this feeling, and drove it down. Yet it made him feel that there could be
      no disloyalty in accepting his Lordship&rsquo;s invitation, because it was given
      in as little friendship as it would be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had almost made my arrangements for quitting the neighborhood,&rdquo; said
      he, after a pause; &ldquo;nor can I shorten the week longer which I had promised
      to spend with my very kind friend, the Warden. Yet your Lordship&rsquo;s
      kindness offers we a great temptation, and I would gladly spend the next
      ensuing week at Braithwaite Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall expect you, then,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite. &ldquo;You will find me quite
      alone, except my chaplain,&mdash;a scholar, and a man of the world, whom
      you will not be sorry to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and took his leave, without shaking hands, as an American would
      have thought it natural to do, after such a hospitable agreement; nor did
      Redclyffe make any motion towards it, and was glad that his Lordship had
      omitted it. On the whole, there was a secret dissatisfaction with himself;
      a sense that he was not doing quite a frank and true thing in accepting
      this invitation, and he only made peace with himself on the consideration
      that Lord Braithwaite was as little cordial in asking the visit as he in
      acceding to it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The guests were now rapidly taking their departure, and the Warden and
      Redclyffe were soon left alone in the antique hall, which now, in its
      solitude, presented an aspect far different from the gay festivity of an
      hour before; the duskiness up in the carved oaken beams seemed to descend
      and fill the hall; and the remembrance of the feast was like one of those
      that had taken place centuries ago, with which this was now numbered, and
      growing ghostly, and faded, and sad, even as they had long been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear friend,&rdquo; said the Warden, stretching himself and yawning,
      &ldquo;it is over. Come into my study with me, and we will have a devilled
      turkey-bone and a pint of sherry in peace and comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I can make no figure at such a supper,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;But I
      admire your inexhaustibleness in being ready for midnight refreshment
      after such a feast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a glass of good liquor has moistened my lips to-night,&rdquo; said the
      Warden, &ldquo;save and except such as was supplied by a decanter of water made
      brown with toast; and such a sip as I took to the health of the Queen, and
      another to that of the Ambassador to Hohen-Linden. It is the only way,
      when a man has this vast labor of speechifying to do; and indeed there is
      no possibility of keeping up a jolly countenance for such a length of time
      except on toast-water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly adjourned to the Warden&rsquo;s sanctum, where that worthy
      dignitary seemed to enjoy himself over his sherry and cracked bones, in a
      degree that he probably had not heretofore; while Redclyffe, whose
      potations had been more liberal, and who was feverish and disturbed, tried
      the effect of a little brandy and soda-water. As often happens at such
      midnight symposiums, the two friends found themselves in a more kindly and
      confidential vein than had happened before, great as had been the kindness
      and confidence already grown up between them. Redclyffe told his friend of
      Lord Braithwaite&rsquo;s invitation, and of his own resolution to accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You will do well,&rdquo; said the Warden; &ldquo;and you will find his
      Lordship an accustomed host, and the old house most interesting. If he
      knows the secrets of it himself, and will show them, they will be well
      worth the seeing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a scruple in accepting this invitation,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see why,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;I advise it by all means, since I
      shall lose nothing by it myself, as it will not lop off any part of your
      visit to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, irresistibly impelled to a confidence
      which he had not meditated a moment before, &ldquo;there is a foolish secret
      which I must tell you, if you will listen to it; and which I have only not
      revealed to you because it seemed to me foolish and dream-like; because,
      too, I am an American, and a democrat; because I am ashamed of myself and
      laugh at myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a long story?&rdquo; asked the Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make it of any length, and almost any brevity,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will fill my pipe then,&rdquo; answered the Warden, &ldquo;and listen at my ease;
      and if, as you intimate, there prove to be any folly in it, I will impute
      it all to the kindly freedom with which you have partaken of our English
      hospitality, and forget it before to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He settled himself in his easy-chair, in a most luxurious posture; and
      Redclyffe, who felt a strange reluctance to reveal&mdash;for the first
      time in his life&mdash;the shadowy hopes, if hopes they were, and
      purposes, if such they could be called, with which he had amused himself
      so many years, begun the story from almost the earliest period that he
      could remember. He told even of his earliest recollection, with an old
      woman, in the almshouse, and how he had been found there by the Doctor,
      and educated by him, with all the hints and half-revelations that had been
      made to him. He described the singular character of the Doctor, his
      scientific pursuits, his evident accomplishments, his great abilities, his
      morbidness and melancholy, his moodiness, and finally his death, and the
      singular circumstances that accompanied it. The story took a considerable
      time to tell; and after its close, the Warden, who had only interrupted it
      by now and then a question to make it plainer, continued to smoke his pipe
      slowly and thoughtfully for a long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Doctor of yours was a singular character,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Evidently, from
      what you tell me as to the accuracy of his local reminiscences, he must
      have been of this part of the country,&mdash;of this immediate
      neighborhood,&mdash;and such a man could not have grown up here without
      being known. I myself&mdash;for I am an old fellow now&mdash;might have
      known him if he lived to manhood hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed old to me when I first knew him,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;But children
      make no distinctions of age. He might have been forty-five then, as well
      as I can judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are now twenty-seven or eight,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;and were four years
      old when you first knew him. He might now be sixty-five. Do you know, my
      friend, that I have something like a certainty that I know who your Doctor
      was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange this seems!&rdquo; exclaimed Redclyffe. &ldquo;It has never struck me
      that I should be able to identify this singular personage with any
      surroundings or any friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Warden, to requite his friend&rsquo;s story,&mdash;and without as yet saying
      a word, good or bad, on his ancestral claims,&mdash;proceeded to tell him
      some of the gossip of the neighborhood,&mdash;what had been gossip thirty
      or forty years ago, but was now forgotten, or, at all events, seldom
      spoken of, and only known to the old, at the present day. He himself
      remembered it only as a boy, and imperfectly. There had been a personage
      of that day, a man of poor estate, who had fallen deeply in love and been
      betrothed to a young lady of family; he was a young man of more than
      ordinary abilities, and of great promise, though small fortune. It was not
      well known how, but the match between him and the young lady was broken
      off, and his place was supplied by the then proprietor of Braithwaite
      Hall; as it was supposed, by the artifices of her mother. There had been
      circumstances of peculiar treachery in the matter, and Mr. Oglethorpe had
      taken it severely to heart; so severely, indeed, that he had left the
      country, after selling his ancestral property, and had only been
      occasionally heard of again. Now, from certain circumstances, it had
      struck the Warden that this might be the mysterious Doctor of whom
      Redclyffe spoke. [Endnote: 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; suggested Redclyffe, &ldquo;should a man with these wrongs to avenge
      take such an interest in a descendant of his enemy&rsquo;s family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a strong point in favor of my supposition,&rdquo; replied the Warden.
      &ldquo;There is certainly, and has long been, a degree of probability that the
      true heir of this family exists in America. If Oglethorpe could discover
      him, he ousts his enemy from the estate and honors, and substitutes the
      person whom he has discovered and educated. Most certainly there is
      revenge in the thing. Should it happen now, however, the triumph would
      have lost its sweetness, even were Oglethorpe alive to partake of it; for
      his enemy is dead, leaving no heir, and this foreign branch has come in
      without Oglethorpe&rsquo;s aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friends remained musing a considerable time, each in his own train of
      thought, till the Warden suddenly spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to prosecute this apparent claim of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not intended to do so,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the Warden, &ldquo;that should depend upon the strength of
      your ground; and I understand you that there is some link wanting to
      establish it. Otherwise, I see not how you can hesitate. Is it a little
      thing to hold a claim to an old English estate and honors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is a very great thing, to an Englishman born, and who need give up
      no higher birthright to avail himself of it,&rdquo; answered Redclyffe. &ldquo;You
      will laugh at me, my friend; but I cannot help feeling that I, a simple
      citizen of a republic, yet with none above me except those whom I help to
      place there,&mdash;and who are my servants, not my superiors,&mdash;must
      stoop to take these honors. I leave a set of institutions which are the
      noblest that the wit and civilization of man have yet conceived, to enlist
      myself in one that is based on a far lower conception of man, and which
      therefore lowers every one who shares in it. Besides,&rdquo; said the young man,
      his eyes kindling with the ambition which had been so active a principle
      in his life, &ldquo;what prospects&mdash;what rewards for spirited exertion&mdash;what
      a career, only open to an American, would I give up, to become merely a
      rich and idle Englishman, belonging (as I should) nowhere, without a
      possibility of struggle, such as a strong man loves, with only a mockery
      of a title, which in these days really means nothing,&mdash;hardly more
      than one of our own Honorables. What has any success in English life to
      offer (even were it within my reach, which, as a stranger, it would not
      be) to balance the proud career of an American statesman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, you might be a President, I suppose,&rdquo; said the Warden, rather
      contemptuously,&mdash;&ldquo;a four years&rsquo; potentate. It seems to me an office
      about on a par with that of the Lord Mayor of London. For my part, I would
      rather be a baron of three or four hundred years&rsquo; antiquity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talk in vain,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, laughing. &ldquo;We do not approach one
      another&rsquo;s ideas on this subject. But, waiving all speculations as to my
      attempting to avail myself of this claim, do you think I can fairly accept
      this invitation to visit Lord Braithwaite? There is certainly a
      possibility that I may arraign myself against his dearest interests.
      Conscious of this, can I accept his hospitality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Warden paused. &ldquo;You have not sought access to his house,&rdquo; he observed.
      &ldquo;You have no designs, it seems, no settled designs at all events, against
      his Lordship,&mdash;nor is there a probability that they would be
      forwarded by your accepting this invitation, even if you had any. I do not
      see but you may go. The only danger is, that his Lordship&rsquo;s engaging
      qualities may seduce you into dropping your claims out of a chivalrous
      feeling, which I see is among your possibilities. To be sure, it would be
      more satisfactory if he knew your actual position, and should then renew
      his invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, looking up from his musing posture,
      &ldquo;that he does know them. You are surprised; but in all Lord Braithwaite&rsquo;s
      manner towards me there has been an undefinable something that makes me
      aware that he knows on what terms we stand towards each other. There is
      nothing inconceivable in this. The family have for generations been
      suspicious of an American line, and have more than once sent messengers to
      try to search out and put a stop to the apprehension. Why should it not
      have come to their knowledge that there was a person with such claims, and
      that he is now in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is possible,&rdquo; replied the Warden, &ldquo;and if you are satisfied
      that his Lordship knows it, or even suspects it, you meet him on fair
      ground. But I fairly tell you, my good friend, that&mdash;his Lordship
      being a man of unknown principles of honor, outlandish, and an Italian in
      habit and moral sense&mdash;I scarcely like to trust you in his house, he
      being aware that your existence may be inimical to him. My humble board is
      the safer of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;You Englishmen are so suspicious of anybody not
      regularly belonging to yourselves. Poison and the dagger haunt your
      conceptions of all others. In America you think we kill every third man
      with the bowie-knife. But, supposing there were any grounds for your
      suspicion, I would still encounter it. An American is no braver than an
      Englishman; but still he is not quite so chary of his life as the latter,
      who never risks it except on the most imminent necessity. We take such
      matters easy. In regard to this invitation, I feel that I can honorably
      accept it, and there are many idle and curious motives that impel me to
      it. I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so; but you must come back to me for another week, after finishing
      your visit,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;After all, it was an idle fancy in me that
      there could be any danger. His Lordship has good English blood in his
      veins, and it would take oceans and rivers of Italian treachery to wash
      out the sterling quality of it. And, my good friend, as to these claims of
      yours, I would not have you trust too much to what is probably a romantic
      dream; yet, were the dream to come true, I should think the British
      peerage honored by such an accession to its ranks. And now to bed; for we
      have heard the chimes of midnight, two hours agone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly retired; and Redclyffe was surprised to find what a
      distinctness his ideas respecting his claim to the Braithwaite honors had
      assumed, now that he, after so many years, had imparted them to another.
      Heretofore, though his imagination had played with them so much, they
      seemed the veriest dreams; now, they had suddenly taken form and hardened
      into substance; and he became aware, in spite of all the lofty and
      patriotic sentiments which he had expressed to the Warden, that these
      prospects had really much importance in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe, during the few days that he was to spend at the Hospital,
      previous to his visit to Braithwaite Hall, was conscious of a restlessness
      such as we have all felt on the eve of some interesting event. He wondered
      at himself at being so much wrought up by so simple a thing as he was
      about to do; but it seemed to him like a coming home after an absence of
      centuries. It was like an actual prospect of entrance into a castle in the
      air,&mdash;the shadowy threshold of which should assume substance enough
      to bear his foot, its thin, fantastic walls actually protect him from sun
      and rain, its hall echo with his footsteps, its hearth warm him. That
      delicious, thrilling uncertainty between reality and fancy, in which he
      had often been enwrapt since his arrival in this region, enveloped him
      more strongly than ever; and with it, too, there came a sort of
      apprehension, which sometimes shuddered through him like an icy draught,
      or the touch of cold steel to his heart. He was ashamed, too, to be
      conscious of anything like fear; yet he would not acknowledge it for fear;
      and indeed there was such an airy, exhilarating, thrilling pleasure bound
      up with it, that it could not really be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this state of mind that, a day or two after the feast, he saw
      Colcord sitting on the bench, before the portal of the Hospital, in the
      sun, which&mdash;September though it was&mdash;still came warm and bright
      (for English sunshine) into that sheltered spot; a spot where many
      generations of old men had warmed their limbs, while they looked down into
      the life, the torpid life, of the old village that trailed its homely yet
      picturesque street along by the venerable buildings of the Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;I am about leaving you, for a time,&mdash;indeed,
      with the limited time at my disposal, it is possible that I may not be
      able to come back hither, except for a brief visit. Before I leave you, I
      would fain know something more about one whom I must ever consider my
      benefactor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, with his usual benignant quiet, &ldquo;I saved your
      life. It is yet to be seen, perhaps, whether thereby I made myself your
      benefactor. I trust so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it so, at least,&rdquo; answered Redclyffe, &ldquo;and I assure you life has a
      new value for me since I came to this place; for I have a deeper hold upon
      it, as it were,&mdash;more hope from it, more trust in something good to
      come of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a good change,&mdash;or should be so,&rdquo; quoth the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; continued Redclyffe, &ldquo;how long you have been a figure in my
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Colcord, &ldquo;though you might well have forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;I remember, as if it were this morning, that
      time in New England when I first saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man with whom you then abode,&rdquo; said Colcord, &ldquo;knew who I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he being dead, and finding you here now, by such a strange
      coincidence,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;and being myself a man capable of taking
      your counsel, I would have you impart it to me: for I assure you that the
      current of my life runs darkly on, and I would be glad of any light on its
      future, or even its present phase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not one of those from whom the world waits for counsel,&rdquo; said the
      pensioner, &ldquo;and I know not that mine would be advantageous to you, in the
      light which men usually prize. Yet if I were to give any, it would be that
      you should be gone hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone hence!&rdquo; repeated Redclyffe, surprised. &ldquo;I tell you&mdash;what I have
      hardly hitherto told to myself&mdash;that all my dreams, all my wishes
      hitherto, have looked forward to precisely the juncture that seems now to
      be approaching. My dreaming childhood dreamt of this. If you know anything
      of me, you know how I sprung out of mystery, akin to none, a thing
      concocted out of the elements, without visible agency; how all through my
      boyhood I was alone; how I grew up without a root, yet continually longing
      for one,&mdash;longing to be connected with somebody, and never feeling
      myself so. Yet there was ever a looking forward to this time at which I
      now find myself. If my next step were death, yet while the path seemed to
      lead toward a certainty of establishing me in connection with my race, I
      would take it. I have tried to keep down this yearning, to stifle it,
      annihilate it, by making a position for myself, by being my own fact; but
      I cannot overcome the natural horror of being a creature floating in the
      air, attached to nothing; ever this feeling that there is no reality in
      the life and fortunes, good or bad, of a being so unconnected. There is
      not even a grave, not a heap of dry bones, not a pinch of dust, with which
      I can claim kindred, unless I find it here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is sad,&rdquo; said the old man,&mdash;&ldquo;this strong yearning, and nothing
      to gratify it. Yet, I warn you, do not seek its gratification here. There
      are delusions, snares, pitfalls, in this life. I warn you, quit the
      search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;I will follow the mysterious clue that seems to
      lead me on; and, even now, it pulls me one step further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It leads me onward even as far as the threshold&mdash;across the
      threshold&mdash;of yonder mansion,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step not across it; there is blood on that threshold!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      pensioner. &ldquo;A bloody footstep emerging. Take heed that there be not as
      bloody a one entering in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Redclyffe, feeling the ridicule of the emotion into which he
      had been betrayed, as the old man&rsquo;s wildness of demeanor made him feel
      that he was talking with a monomaniac. &ldquo;We are talking idly. I do but go,
      in the common intercourse of society, to see the old English residence
      which (such is the unhappy obscurity of my position) I fancy, among a
      thousand others, may have been that of my ancestors. Nothing is likely to
      come of it. My foot is not bloody, nor polluted with anything except the
      mud of the damp English soil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet go not in!&rdquo; persisted the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must go,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, determinedly, &ldquo;and I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ashamed to have been moved to such idle utterances by anything that the
      old man could say Redclyffe turned away, though he still heard the sad,
      half-uttered remonstrance of the old man, like a moan behind him, and
      wondered what strange fancy had taken possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect which this opposition had upon him made him the more aware how
      much his heart was set upon this visit to the Hall; how much he had
      counted upon being domiciliated there; what a wrench it would be to him to
      tear himself away without going into that mansion, and penetrating all the
      mysteries wherewith his imagination, exercising itself upon the theme
      since the days of the old Doctor&rsquo;s fireside talk, had invested it. In his
      agitation he wandered forth from the Hospital, and, passing through the
      village street, found himself in the park of Braithwaite Hall, where he
      wandered for a space, until his steps led him to a point whence the
      venerable Hall appeared, with its limes and its oaks around it; its look
      of peace, and aged repose, and loveliness; its stately domesticity, so
      ancient, so beautiful; its mild, sweet simplicity; it seemed the ideal of
      home. The thought thrilled his bosom, that this was his home,&mdash;the
      home of the wild Western wanderer, who had gone away centuries ago, and
      encountered strange chances, and almost forgotten his origin, but still
      kept a clue to bring him back; and had now come back, and found all the
      original emotions safe within him. It even seemed to him, that, by his
      kindred with those who had gone before,&mdash;by the line of sensitive
      blood linking him with that final emigrant,&mdash;he could remember all
      these objects;&mdash;that tree, hardly more venerable now than then; that
      clock-tower, still marking the elapsing time; that spire of the old
      church, raising itself beyond. He spread out his arms in a kind of
      rapture, and exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O home, my home, my forefathers&rsquo; home! I have come back to thee! The
      wanderer has come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight stir near him; and on a mossy seat, that was arranged
      to take advantage of a remarkably good point of view of the old Hall, he
      saw Elsie sitting. She had her drawing-materials with her, and had
      probably been taking a sketch. Redclyffe was ashamed of having been
      overheard by any one giving way to such idle passion as he had been
      betrayed into; and yet, in another sense, he was glad,&mdash;glad, at
      least, that something of his feeling, as yet unspoken to human being, was
      shared, and shared by her with whom, alone of living beings, he had any
      sympathies of old date, and whom he often thought of with feelings that
      drew him irresistibly towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsie,&rdquo; said he, uttering for the first time the old name, &ldquo;Providence
      makes you my confidant. We have recognized each other, though no word has
      passed between us. Let us speak now again with one another. How came you
      hither? What has brought us together again?&mdash;Away with this
      strangeness that lurks between us! Let us meet as those who began life
      together, and whose life-strings, being so early twisted in unison, cannot
      now be torn apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not wise,&rdquo; said Elsie, in a faltering voice, &ldquo;to break the
      restraint we have tacitly imposed upon ourselves. Do not let us speak
      further on this subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strangely everything evades me!&rdquo; exclaimed Redclyffe. &ldquo;I seem to be
      in a land of enchantment, where I can get hold of nothing that lends me a
      firm support. There is no medium in my life between the most vulgar
      realities and the most vaporous fiction, too thin to breathe. Tell me,
      Elsie, how came you here? Why do you not meet me frankly? What is there to
      keep you apart from the oldest friend, I am bold to say, you have on
      earth? Are you an English girl? Are you one of our own New England
      maidens, with her freedom, and her know-how, and her force, beyond
      anything that these demure and decorous damsels can know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is wild,&rdquo; said Elsie, straggling for composure, yet strongly moved
      by the recollections that he brought up. &ldquo;It is best that we should meet
      as strangers, and so part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Redclyffe; &ldquo;the long past comes up, with its memories, and yet
      it is not so powerful as the powerful present. We have met again; our
      adventures have shown that Providence has designed a relation in my fate
      to yours. Elsie, are you lonely as I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I have bonds, ties, a life, a duty. I must live that
      life and do that duty. You have, likewise, both. Do yours, lead your own
      life, like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Elsie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whither that life is now tending?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither?&rdquo; said she, turning towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To yonder Hall,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started up, and clasped her hands about his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;go not thither! There is blood upon the
      threshold! Return: a dreadful fatality awaits you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I yield my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; said Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I, too, tell you it cannot be,&rdquo; returned Redclyffe. [Endnote: 2.]

    <p>
      The dialogue had reached this point, when there came a step along the
      wood-path; the branches rustled, and there was Lord Braithwaite, looking
      upon the pair with the ordinary slightly sarcastic glance with which he
      gazed upon the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine morning, fair lady and fair sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We have few such,
      except in Italy.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      So Redclyffe left the Hospital, where he had spent many weeks of strange
      and not unhappy life, and went to accept the invitation of the lord of
      Braithwaite Hall. It was with a thrill of strange delight, poignant almost
      to pain, that he found himself driving up to the door of the Hall, and
      actually passing the threshold of the house. He looked, as he stept over
      it, for the Bloody Footstep, with which the house had so long been
      associated in his imagination; but could nowhere see it. The footman
      ushered him into a hall, which seemed to be in the centre of the building,
      and where, little as the autumn was advanced, a fire was nevertheless
      burning and glowing on the hearth; nor was its effect undesirable in the
      somewhat gloomy room. The servants had evidently received orders
      respecting the guest; for they ushered him at once to his chamber, which
      seemed not to be one of those bachelor&rsquo;s rooms, where, in an English
      mansion, young and single men are forced to be entertained with very bare
      and straitened accommodations; but a large, well, though antiquely and
      solemnly furnished room, with a curtained bed, and all manner of elaborate
      contrivances for repose; but the deep embrasures of the windows made it
      gloomy, with the little light that they admitted through their small
      panes. There must have been English attendance in this department of the
      household arrangements, at least; for nothing could exceed the exquisite
      nicety and finish of everything in the room, the cleanliness, the
      attention to comfort, amid antique aspects of furniture; the rich, deep
      preparations for repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant told Redclyffe that his master had ridden out, and, adding
      that luncheon would be on the table at two o&rsquo;clock, left him; and
      Redclyffe sat some time trying to make out and distinguish the feelings
      with which he found himself here, and realizing a lifelong dream. He ran
      back over all the legends which the Doctor used to tell about this
      mansion, and wondered whether this old, rich chamber were the one where
      any of them had taken place; whether the shadows of the dead haunted here.
      But, indeed, if this were the case, the apartment must have been very much
      changed, antique though it looked, with the second, or third, or whatever
      other numbered arrangement, since those old days of tapestry hangings and
      rush-strewed floor. Otherwise this stately and gloomy chamber was as
      likely as any other to have been the one where his ancestor appeared for
      the last time in the paternal mansion; here he might have been the night
      before that mysterious Bloody Footstep was left on the threshold, whence
      had arisen so many wild legends, and since the impression of which nothing
      certain had ever been known respecting that ill-fated man,&mdash;nothing
      certain in England at least,&mdash;and whose story was left so ragged and
      questionable even by all that he could add.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do what he could, Redclyffe still was not conscious of that deep
      home-feeling which he had imagined he should experience when, if ever, he
      should come back to the old ancestral place; there was strangeness, a
      struggle within himself to get hold of something that escaped him, an
      effort to impress on his mind the fact that he was, at last, established
      at his temporary home in the place that he had so long looked forward to,
      and that this was the moment which he would have thought more interesting
      than any other in his life. He was strangely cold and indifferent, frozen
      up as it were, and fancied that he would have cared little had he been to
      leave the mansion without so much as looking over the remaining part of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, he became weary of sitting and indulging this fantastic humor of
      indifference, and emerged from his chamber with the design of finding his
      way about the lower part of the house. The mansion had that delightful
      intricacy which can never be contrived; never be attained by design; but
      is the happy result of where many builders, many designs,&mdash;many ages,
      perhaps,&mdash;have concurred in a structure, each pursuing his own
      design. Thus it was a house that you could go astray in, as in a city, and
      come to unexpected places, but never, until after much accustomance, go
      where you wished; so Redclyffe, although the great staircase and wide
      corridor by which he had been led to his room seemed easy to find, yet
      soon discovered that he was involved in an unknown labyrinth, where
      strange little bits of staircases led up and down, and where passages
      promised much in letting him out, but performed nothing. To be sure, the
      old English mansion had not much of the stateliness of one of Mrs.
      Radcliffe&rsquo;s castles, with their suites of rooms opening one into another;
      but yet its very domesticity&mdash;its look as if long ago it had been
      lived in&mdash;made it only the more ghostly; and so Redclyffe felt the
      more as if he were wandering through a homely dream; sensible of the
      ludicrousness of his position, he once called aloud; but his voice echoed
      along the passages, sounding unwontedly to his ears, but arousing nobody.
      It did not seem to him as if he were going afar, but were bewildered round
      and round, within a very small compass; a predicament in which a man feels
      very foolish usually.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood at an old window, stone-mullioned, at the end of a passage
      into which he had come twice over, a door near him opened, and a personage
      looked out whom he had not before seen. It was a face of great keenness
      and intelligence, and not unpleasant to look at, though dark and sallow.
      The dress had something which Redclyffe recognized as clerical, though not
      exactly pertaining to the Church of England,&mdash;a sort of arrangement
      of the vest and shirt-collar; and he had knee breeches of black. He did
      not seem like an English clerical personage, however; for even in this
      little glimpse of him Redclyffe saw a mildness, gentleness, softness, and
      asking-of-leave, in his manner, which he had not observed in persons so
      well assured of their position as the Church of England clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed at once to detect Redclyffe&rsquo;s predicament, and came forward with
      a pleasant smile, speaking in good English, though with a somewhat foreign
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, you have lost your way. It is a labyrinthian house for its size,
      this old English Hall,&mdash;full of perplexity. Shall I show you to any
      point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, laughing, &ldquo;I hardly know whither I want to
      go; being a stranger, and yet knowing nothing of the public places of the
      house. To the library, perhaps, if you will be good enough to direct me
      thither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the clerical personage; &ldquo;the more easily
      too, as my own quarters are close adjacent; the library being my province.
      Do me the favor to enter here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the priest ushered Redclyffe into an austere-looking yet
      exceedingly neat study, as it seemed, on one side of which was an oratory,
      with a crucifix and other accommodations for Catholic devotion. Behind a
      white curtain there were glimpses of a bed, which seemed arranged on a
      principle of conventual austerity in respect to limits and lack of
      softness; but still there was in the whole austerity of the premises a
      certain character of restraint, poise, principle, which Redclyffe liked. A
      table was covered with books, many of them folios in an antique binding of
      parchment, and others were small, thick-set volumes, into which antique
      lore was rammed and compressed. Through an open door, opposite to the one
      by which he had entered, there was a vista of a larger apartment, with
      alcoves, a rather dreary-looking room, though a little sunshine came
      through a window at the further end, distained with colored glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit down in my little home?&rdquo; said the courteous priest. &ldquo;I hope
      we may be better acquainted; so allow me to introduce myself. I am Father
      Angelo, domestic chaplain to his Lordship. You, I know, are the American
      diplomatic gentleman, from whom his Lordship has been expecting a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am most happy to know you,&rdquo; continued the priest. &ldquo;Ah; you have a happy
      country, most catholic, most recipient of all that is outcast on earth.
      Men of my religion must ever bless it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly ought to be remembered to our credit,&rdquo; replied Redclyffe,
      &ldquo;that we have shown no narrow spirit in this matter, and have not, like
      other Protestant countries, rejected the good that is found in any man on
      account of his religious faith. American statesmanship comprises Jew,
      Catholic, all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this pleasant little acknowledgment, there ensued a conversation
      having some reference to books; for though Redclyffe, of late years, had
      known little of what deserves to be called literature,&mdash;having found
      political life as much estranged from it as it is apt to be with
      politicians,&mdash;yet he had early snuffed the musty fragrance of the
      Doctor&rsquo;s books, and had learned to love its atmosphere. At the time he
      left college, he was just at the point where he might have been a scholar;
      but the active tendencies of American life had interfered with him, as
      with thousands of others, and drawn him away from pursuits which might
      have been better adapted to some of his characteristics than the one he
      had adopted. The priest gently felt and touched around his pursuits, and
      finding some remains of classic culture, he kept up a conversation on
      these points; showing him the possessions of the library in that
      department, where, indeed, were some treasures that he had discovered, and
      which seemed to have been collected at least a century ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generally, however,&rdquo; observed he, as they passed from one dark alcove to
      another, &ldquo;the library is of little worth, except to show how much of
      living truth each generation contributes to the botheration of life, and
      what a public benefactor a bookworm is, after all. There, now! did you
      ever happen to see one? Here is one that I have watched at work, some time
      past, and have not thought it worth while to stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe looked at the learned little insect, who was eating a strange
      sort of circular trench into an old book of scholastic Latin, which
      probably only he had ever devoured,&mdash;at least ever found to his
      taste. The insect seemed in excellent condition, fat with learning, having
      doubtless got the essence of the book into himself. But Redclyffe was
      still more interested in observing in the corner a great spider, which
      really startled him,&mdash;not so much for its own terrible aspect, though
      that was monstrous, as because he seemed to see in it the very great
      spider which he had known in his boyhood; that same monster that had been
      the Doctor&rsquo;s familiar, and had been said to have had an influence in his
      death. He looked so startled that Father Angelo observed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be frightened,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;though I allow that a brave man may well
      be afraid of a spider, and that the bravest of the brave need not blush to
      shudder at this one. There is a great mystery about this spider. No one
      knows whence he came; nor how long he has been here. The library was very
      much shut up during the time of the last inheritor of the estate, and had
      not been thoroughly examined for some years when I opened it, and swept
      some of the dust away from its old alcoves. I myself was not aware of this
      monster until the lapse of some weeks, when I was startled at seeing him,
      one day, as I was reading an old book here. He dangled down from the
      ceiling, by the cordage of his web, and positively seemed to look into my
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is of the species Condetas,&rdquo; said Redclyffe,&mdash;&ldquo;a rare spider
      seldom seen out of the tropic regions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are learned, then, in spiders,&rdquo; observed the priest, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could almost make oath, at least, that I have known this ugly specimen
      of his race,&rdquo; observed Redclyffe. &ldquo;A very dear friend, now deceased, to
      whom I owed the highest obligations, was studious of spiders, and his
      chief treasure was one the very image of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;There has always appeared to me to be
      something uncanny in spiders. I should be glad to talk further with you on
      this subject. Several times I have fancied a strange intelligence in this
      monster; but I have natural horror of him, and therefore refrain from
      interviews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do wisely, sir,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;His powers and purposes are
      questionably beneficent, at best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the many-legged monster made the old library ghostly to him by
      the associations which it summoned up, and by the idea that it was really
      the identical one that had seemed so stuffed with poison, in the lifetime
      of the Doctor, and at that so distant spot. Yet, on reflection, it
      appeared not so strange; for the old Doctor&rsquo;s spider, as he had heard him
      say, was one of an ancestral race that he had brought from beyond the sea.
      They might have been preserved, for ages possibly, in this old library,
      whence the Doctor had perhaps taken his specimen, and possibly the one now
      before him was the sole survivor. It hardly, however, made the monster any
      the less hideous to suppose that this might be the case; and to fancy the
      poison of old times condensed into this animal, who might have sucked the
      diseases, moral and physical, of all this family into him, and to have
      made himself their demon. He questioned with himself whether it might not
      be well to crush him at once, and so perhaps do away with the evil of
      which he was the emblem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt a strange disposition to crush this monster at first,&rdquo; remarked
      the priest, as if he knew what Redclyffe was thinking of,&mdash;&ldquo;a feeling
      that in so doing I should get rid of a mischief; but then he is such a
      curious monster. You cannot long look at him without coming to the
      conclusion that he is indestructible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and to think of crushing such a deep-bowelled monster!&rdquo; said
      Redclyffe, shuddering. &ldquo;It is too great a catastrophe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation in which he was so deeply concerned, the spider
      withdrew himself, and hand over hand ascended to a remote and dusky
      corner, where was his hereditary abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I be likely to meet Lord Braithwaite here in the library?&rdquo; asked
      Redclyffe, when the fiend had withdrawn himself. &ldquo;I have not yet seen him
      since my arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; said the priest, with great courtesy, &ldquo;that you are aware of
      some peculiarities in his Lordship&rsquo;s habits, which imply nothing in
      detriment to the great respect which he pays all his few guests, and
      which, I know, he is especially desirous to pay to you. I think that we
      shall meet him at lunch, which, though an English institution, his
      Lordship has adopted very readily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, willing to know how far he might be
      expected to comply with the peculiarities&mdash;which might prove to be
      eccentricities&mdash;of his host, &ldquo;that my presence here will not be too
      greatly at variance with his Lordship&rsquo;s habits, whatever they may be. I
      came hither, indeed, on the pledge that, as my host would not stand in my
      way, so neither would I in his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the true principle,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;and here comes his
      Lordship in person to begin the practice of it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Braithwaite came into the principal door of the library as the priest
      was speaking, and stood a moment just upon the threshold, looking keenly
      out of the stronger light into this dull and darksome apartment, as if
      unable to see perfectly what was within; or rather, as Redclyffe fancied,
      trying to discover what was passing between those two. And, indeed, as
      when a third person comes suddenly upon two who are talking of him, the
      two generally evince in their manner some consciousness of the fact; so it
      was in this case, with Redclyffe at least, although the priest seemed
      perfectly undisturbed, either through practice of concealment, or because
      he had nothing to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, came forward, presenting his hand to
      Redclyffe, who shook it, and not without a certain cordiality; till he
      perceived that it was the left hand, when he probably intimated some
      surprise by a change of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an awkward person,&rdquo; said his Lordship. &ldquo;The left hand, however, is
      nearest the heart; so be assured I mean no discourtesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signor Ambassador and myself,&rdquo; observed the priest, &ldquo;have had a most
      interesting conversation (to me at least) about books and bookworms,
      spiders, and other congruous matters; and I find his Excellency has
      heretofore made acquaintance with a great spider bearing strong
      resemblance to the hermit of our library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said his Lordship. &ldquo;I was not aware that America had yet enough
      of age and old misfortune, crime, sordidness, that accumulate with it, to
      have produced spiders like this. Had he sucked into himself all the
      noisomeness of your heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe made some slight answer, that the spider was a sort of pet of an
      old virtuoso to whom he owed many obligations in his boyhood; and the
      conversation turned from this subject to others suggested by topics of the
      day and place. His Lordship was affable, and Redclyffe could not, it must
      be confessed, see anything to justify the prejudices of the neighbors
      against him. Indeed, he was inclined to attribute them, in great measure,
      to the narrowness of the English view,&mdash;to those insular prejudices
      which have always prevented them from fully appreciating what differs from
      their own habits. At lunch, which was soon announced, the party of three
      became very pleasant and sociable, his Lordship drinking a light Italian
      red wine, and recommending it to Redclyffe; who, however, was English
      enough to prefer some bitter ale, while the priest contented himself with
      pure water,&mdash;which is, in truth, a less agreeable drink in chill,
      moist England than in any country we are acquainted with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must make yourself quite at home here,&rdquo; said his Lordship, as they
      rose from table. &ldquo;I am not a good host, nor a very genial man, I believe.
      I can do little to entertain you; but here is the house and the grounds at
      your disposal,&mdash;horses in the stable,&mdash;guns in the hall,&mdash;here
      is Father Angelo, good at chess. There is the library. Pray make the most
      of them all; and if I can contribute in any way to your pleasure, let me
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this certainly seemed cordial, and the manner in which it was said
      seemed in accordance with the spirit of the words; and yet, whether the
      fault was in anything of morbid suspicion in Redclyffe&rsquo;s nature, or
      whatever it was, it did not have the effect of making him feel welcome,
      which almost every Englishman has the natural faculty of producing on a
      guest, when once he has admitted him beneath his roof. It might be in
      great measure his face, so thin and refined, and intellectual without
      feeling; his voice which had melody, but not heartiness; his manners,
      which were not simple by nature, but by art;&mdash;whatever it was,
      Redclyffe found that Lord Braithwaite did not call for his own naturalness
      and simplicity, but his art, and felt that he was inevitably acting a part
      in his intercourse with him, that he was on his guard, playing a game; and
      yet he did not wish to do this. But there was a mobility, a subtleness in
      his nature, an unconscious tact,&mdash;which the mode of life and of
      mixing with men in America fosters and perfects,&mdash;that made this sort
      of finesse inevitable to him, with any but a natural character; with whom,
      on the other hand, Redclyffe could be as fresh and natural as any
      Englishman of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe spent the time between lunch and dinner in wandering about the
      grounds, from which he had hitherto felt himself debarred by motives of
      delicacy. It was a most interesting ramble to him, coming to trees which
      his ancestor, who went to America, might have climbed in his boyhood,
      might have sat beneath, with his lady-love, in his youth; deer there were,
      the descendants of those which he had seen; old stone stiles, which his
      foot had trodden. The sombre, clouded light of the day fell down upon this
      scene, which in its verdure, its luxuriance of vegetable life, was purely
      English, cultivated to the last extent without losing the nature out of a
      single thing. In the course of his walk he came to the spot where he had
      been so mysteriously wounded on his first arrival in this region; and,
      examining the spot, he was startled to see that there was a path leading
      to the other side of a hedge, and this path, which led to the house, had
      brought him here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musing upon this mysterious circumstance, and how it should have happened
      in so orderly a country as England, so tamed and subjected to
      civilization,&mdash;an incident to happen in an English park which seemed
      better suited to the Indian-haunted forests of the wilder parts of his own
      land,&mdash;and how no researches which the Warden had instituted had
      served in the smallest degree to develop the mystery,&mdash;he clambered
      over the hedge, and followed the footpath. It plunged into dells, and
      emerged from them, led through scenes which seemed those of old romances,
      and at last, by these devious ways, began to approach the old house,
      which, with its many gray gables, put on a new aspect from this point of
      view. Redclyffe admired its venerableness anew; the ivy that overran parts
      of it; the marks of age; and wondered at the firmness of the institutions
      which, through all the changes that come to man, could have kept this
      house the home of one lineal race for so many centuries; so many, that the
      absence of his own branch from it seemed but a temporary visit to foreign
      parts, from which he was now returned, to be again at home, by the old
      hearthstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do I mean to do?&rdquo; said he to himself, stopping short, and still
      looking at the old house. &ldquo;Am I ready to give up all the actual life
      before me for the sake of taking up with what I feel to be a less
      developed state of human life? Would it not be better for me to depart
      now, to turn my back on this flattering prospect? I am not fit to be here,&mdash;I,
      so strongly susceptible of a newer, more stirring life than these men
      lead; I, who feel that, whatever the thought and cultivation of England
      may be, my own countrymen have gone forward a long, long march beyond
      them, not intellectually, but in a way that gives them a further start. If
      I come back hither, with the purpose to make myself an Englishman,
      especially an Englishman of rank and hereditary estate,&mdash;then for me
      America has been discovered in vain, and the great spirit that has been
      breathed into us is in vain; and I am false to it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But again came silently swelling over him like a flood all that ancient
      peace, and quietude, and dignity, which looked so stately and beautiful as
      brooding round the old house; all that blessed order of ranks, that sweet
      superiority, and yet with no disclaimer of common brotherhood, that
      existed between the English gentleman and his inferiors; all that
      delightful intercourse, so sure of pleasure, so safe from rudeness,
      lowness, unpleasant rubs, that exists between gentleman and gentleman,
      where, in public affairs, all are essentially of one mind, or seem so to
      an American politician, accustomed to the fierce conflicts of our
      embittered parties; where life was made so enticing, so refined, and yet
      with a sort of homeliness that seemed to show that all its strength was
      left behind; that seeming taking in of all that was desirable in life, and
      all its grace and beauty, yet never giving life a hard enamel of
      over-refinement. What could there be in the wild, harsh, ill-conducted
      American approach to civilization, which could compare with this? What to
      compare with this juiciness and richness? What other men had ever got so
      much out of life as the polished and wealthy Englishmen of to-day? What
      higher part was to be acted, than seemed to lie before him, if he willed
      to accept it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his walk, and, drawing near the manor-house, found that he was
      approaching another entrance than that which had at first admitted him; a
      very pleasant entrance it was, beneath a porch, of antique form, and
      ivy-clad, hospitable and inviting; and it being the approach from the
      grounds, it seemed to be more appropriate to the residents of the house
      than the other one. Drawing near, Redclyffe saw that a flight of steps
      ascended within the porch, old-looking, much worn; and nothing is more
      suggestive of long time than a flight of worn steps; it must have taken so
      many soles, through so many years, to make an impression. Judging from the
      make of the outside of the edifice, Redclyffe thought that he could make
      out the way from the porch to the hall and library; so he determined to
      enter this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been, as was not unusual, a little shower of rain during the
      afternoon; and as Redclyffe came close to the steps, they were glistening
      with the wet. The stones were whitish, like marble, and one of them bore
      on it a token that made him pause, while a thrill like terror ran through
      his system. For it was the mark of a footstep, very decidedly made out,
      and red, like blood,&mdash;the Bloody Footstep,&mdash;the mark of a foot,
      which seemed to have been slightly impressed into the rock, as if it had
      been a soft substance, at the same time sliding a little, and gushing with
      blood. The glistening moisture of which we have spoken made it appear as
      if it were just freshly stamped there; and it suggested to Redclyffe&rsquo;s
      fancy the idea, that, impressed more than two centuries ago, there was
      some charm connected with the mark which kept it still fresh, and would
      continue to do so to the end of time. It was well that there was no
      spectator there,&mdash;for the American would have blushed to have it
      known how much this old traditionary wonder had affected his imagination.
      But, indeed, it was as old as any bugbear of his mind&mdash;as any of
      those bugbears and private terrors which grow up with people, and make the
      dreams and nightmares of childhood, and the fever-images of mature years,
      till they haunt the deliriums of the dying bed, and after that possibly,
      are either realized or known no more. The Doctor&rsquo;s strange story vividly
      recurred to him, and all the horrors which he had since associated with
      this trace; and it seemed to him as if he had now struck upon a bloody
      track, and as if there were other tracks of this supernatural foot which
      he was bound to search out; removing the dust of ages that had settled on
      them, the moss and deep grass that had grown over them, the forest leaves
      that might have fallen on them in America&mdash;marking out the pathway,
      till the pedestrian lay down in his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foot was issuing from, not entering into, the house. Whoever had
      impressed it, or on whatever occasion, he had gone forth, and doubtless to
      return no more. Redclyffe was impelled to place his own foot on the track;
      and the action, as it were, suggested in itself strange ideas of what had
      been the state of mind of the man who planted it there; and he felt a
      strange, vague, yet strong surmise of some agony, some terror and horror,
      that had passed here, and would not fade out of the spot. While he was in
      these musings, he saw Lord Braithwaite looking at him through the glass of
      the porch, with fixed, curious eyes, and a smile on his face. On
      perceiving that Redclyffe was aware of his presence, he came forth without
      appearing in the least disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of the Bloody Footstep?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, undoubtedly,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, stooping to examine it more
      closely, &ldquo;a good thing to make a legend out of; and, like most legendary
      lore, not capable of bearing close examination. I should decidedly say
      that the Bloody Footstep is a natural reddish stain in the stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, indeed?&rdquo; rejoined his Lordship. &ldquo;It may be; but in that
      case, if not the record of an actual deed,&mdash;of a foot stamped down
      there in guilt and agony, and oozing out with unwipeupable blood,&mdash;we
      may consider it as prophetic;&mdash;as foreboding, from the time when the
      stone was squared and smoothed, and laid at this threshold, that a fatal
      footstep was really to be impressed here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an ingenious supposition,&rdquo; said Redclyffe. &ldquo;But is there any sure
      knowledge that the prophecy you suppose has yet been fulfilled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, it might yet be in the future,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite. &ldquo;But I
      think there are enough in the records of this family to prove that there
      did one cross this threshold in a bloody agony, who has since returned no
      more. Great seekings, I have understood, have been had throughout the
      world for him, or for any sign of him, but nothing satisfactory has been
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is now too late to expect it,&rdquo; observed the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied the nobleman, with a glance that Redclyffe thought
      had peculiar meaning in it. &ldquo;Ah! it is very curious to see what turnings
      up there are in this world of old circumstances that seem buried forever;
      how things come back, like echoes that have rolled away among the hills
      and been seemingly hushed forever. We cannot tell when a thing is really
      dead; it comes to life, perhaps in its old shape, perhaps in a new and
      unexpected one; so that nothing really vanishes out of the world. I wish
      it did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation now ceased, and Redclyffe entered the house, where he
      amused himself for some time in looking at the ancient hall, with its
      gallery, its armor, and its antique fireplace, on the hearth of which
      burned a genial fire. He wondered whether in that fire was the continuance
      of that custom which the Doctor&rsquo;s legend spoke of, and that the flame had
      been kept up there two hundred years, in expectation of the wanderer&rsquo;s
      return. It might be so, although the climate of England made it a natural
      custom enough, in a large and damp old room, into which many doors opened,
      both from the exterior and interior of the mansion; but it was pleasant to
      think the custom a traditionary one, and to fancy that a booted figure,
      enveloped in a cloak, might still arrive, and fling open the veiling
      cloak, throw off the sombre and drooping-brimmed hat, and show features
      that were similar to those seen in pictured faces on the walls. Was he
      himself&mdash;in another guise, as Lord Braithwaite had been saying&mdash;that
      long-expected one? Was his the echoing tread that had been heard so long
      through the ages&mdash;so far through the wide world&mdash;approaching the
      blood-stained threshold?
    </p>
    <p>
      With such thoughts, or dreams (for they were hardly sincerely enough
      entertained to be called thoughts), Redclyffe spent the day; a strange,
      delicious day, in spite of the sombre shadows that enveloped it. He
      fancied himself strangely wonted, already, to the house; as if his every
      part and peculiarity had at once fitted into its nooks, and corners, and
      crannies; but, indeed, his mobile nature and active fancy were not
      entirely to be trusted in this matter; it was, perhaps, his American
      faculty of making himself at home anywhere, that he mistook for the
      feeling of being peculiarly at home here.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Redclyffe was now established in the great house which had been so long
      and so singularly an object of interest with him. With his customary
      impressibility by the influences around him, he begun to take in the
      circumstances, and to understand them by more subtile tokens than he could
      well explain to himself. There was the steward, [Endnote: 1] or whatever
      was his precise office; so quiet, so subdued, so nervous, so strange! What
      had been this man&rsquo;s history? What was now the secret of his daily life?
      There he was, creeping stealthily up and down the staircases, and about
      the passages of the house; always as if he were afraid of meeting
      somebody. On seeing Redclyffe in the house, the latter fancied that the
      man expressed a kind of interest in his face; but whether pleasure or pain
      he could not well tell; only he sometimes found that he was contemplating
      him from a distance, or from the obscurity of the room in which he sat,&mdash;or
      from a corridor, while he smoked his cigar on the lawn. A great part, if
      not the whole of this, he imputed to his knowledge of Redclyffe&rsquo;s
      connections with the Doctor; but yet this hardly seemed sufficient to
      account for the pertinacity with which the old man haunted his footsteps,&mdash;the
      poor, nervous old thing,&mdash;always near him, or often unexpectedly so;
      and yet apparently not very willing to hold conversation with him, having
      nothing of importance to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Omskirk,&rdquo; said Redclyffe to him, a day or two after the commencement
      of his visit, &ldquo;how many years have you now been in this situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;0, sir, ever since the Doctor&rsquo;s departure for America,&rdquo; said Omskirk,
      &ldquo;now thirty and five years, five months, and three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, smiling, &ldquo;and you seem to keep the account
      of it very accurately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very long time, your honor,&rdquo; said Omskirk; &ldquo;so long, that I seem to
      have lived one life before it began, and I cannot think of any life than
      just what I had. My life was broken off short in the midst; and what
      belonged to the earlier part of it was another man&rsquo;s life; this is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be a pleasant life enough, I should think, in this fine old
      Hall,&rdquo; said Redclyffe; &ldquo;rather monotonous, however. Would you not like a
      relaxation of a few days, a pleasure trip, in all these thirty-five years?
      You old Englishmen are so sturdily faithful to one thing. You do not
      resemble my countrymen in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;0, none of them ever lived in an old mansion-house like this,&rdquo; replied
      Omskirk, &ldquo;they do not know the sort of habits that a man gets here. They
      do not know my business either, nor any man&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your master then, so difficult?&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master! Who was speaking of him?&rdquo; said the old man, as if surprised.
      &ldquo;Ah, I was thinking of Dr. Grimshawe. He was my master, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Redclyffe was again inconceivably struck with the strength of the
      impression that was made on the poor old man&rsquo;s mind by the character of
      the old Doctor; so that, after thirty years of other service, he still
      felt him to be the master, and could not in the least release himself from
      those earlier bonds. He remembered a story that the Doctor used to tell of
      his once recovering a hanged person, and more and more came to the
      conclusion that this was the man, and that, as the Doctor had said, this
      hold of a strong mind over a weak one, strengthened by the idea that he
      had made him, had subjected the man to him in a kind of slavery that
      embraced the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, again, the lord of the estate interested him greatly, and not
      unpleasantly. He compared what he seemed to be now with what, according to
      all reports, he had been in the past, and could make nothing of it, nor
      reconcile the two characters in the least. It seemed as if the estate were
      possessed by a devil,&mdash;a foul and melancholy fiend,&mdash;who
      resented the attempted possession of others by subjecting them to himself.
      One had turned from quiet and sober habits to reckless dissipation;
      another had turned from the usual gayety of life to recluse habits, and
      both, apparently, by the same influence; at least, so it appeared to
      Redclyffe, as he insulated their story from all other circumstances, and
      looked at them by one light. He even thought that he felt a similar
      influence coming over himself, even in this little time that he had spent
      here; gradually, should this be his permanent residence,&mdash;and not so
      very gradually either,&mdash;there would come its own individual mode of
      change over him. That quick suggestive mind would gather the moss and
      lichens of decay. Palsy of its powers would probably be the form it would
      assume. He looked back through the vanished years to the time which he had
      spent with the old Doctor, and he felt unaccountably as if the mysterious
      old man were yet ruling him, as he did in his boyhood; as if his
      inscrutable, inevitable eye were upon him in all his movements; nay, as if
      he had guided every step that he took in coming hither, and were stalking
      mistily before him, leading him about. He sometimes would gladly have
      given up all these wild and enticing prospects, these dreams that had
      occupied him so long, if he could only have gone away and looked back upon
      the house, its inmates, and his own recollections no more; but there came
      a fate, and took the shape of the old Doctor&rsquo;s apparition, holding him
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, too, the thought of Elsie had much influence in keeping him
      quietly here; her natural sunshine was the one thing that, just now,
      seemed to have a good influence upon the world. She, too, was evidently
      connected with this place, and with the fate, whatever it might be, that
      awaited him here. The Doctor, the ruler of his destiny, had provided her
      as well as all the rest; and from his grave, or wherever he was, he still
      seemed to bring them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here, in this darkened dream, he waited for what should come to pass;
      and daily, when he sat down in the dark old library, it was with the
      thought that this day might bring to a close the doubt amid which he
      lived,&mdash;might give him the impetus to go forward. In such a state, no
      doubt, the witchcraft of the place was really to be recognized, the old
      witchcraft, too, of the Doctor, which he had escaped by the quick
      ebullition of youthful spirit, long ago, while the Doctor lived; but which
      had been stored up till now, till an influence that remained latent for
      years had worked out in active disease. He held himself open for
      intercourse with the lord of the mansion; and intercourse of a certain
      nature they certainly had, but not of the kind which Redclyffe desired.
      They talked together of politics, of the state of the relations between
      England and America, of the court to which Redclyffe was accredited;
      sometimes Redclyffe tried to lead the conversation to the family topics,
      nor, in truth, did Lord Braithwaite seem to decline his lead; although it
      was observable that very speedily the conversation would be found turned
      upon some other subject, to which it had swerved aside by subtle underhand
      movements. Yet Redclyffe was not the less determined, and at no distant
      period, to bring up the subject on which his mind dwelt so much, and have
      it fairly discussed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sometimes a little frightened at the position and circumstances in
      which he found himself; a great disturbance there was in his being, the
      causes of which he could not trace. It had an influence on his dreams,
      through which the Doctor seemed to pass continually, and when he awoke it
      was often with the sensation that he had just the moment before been
      holding conversation with the old man, and that the latter&mdash;with that
      gesture of power that he remembered so well&mdash;had been impressing some
      command upon him; but what that command was, he could not possibly call to
      mind. He wandered among the dark passages of the house, and up its antique
      staircases, as if expecting at every turn to meet some one who would have
      the word of destiny to say to him. When he went forth into the park, it
      was as if to hold an appointment with one who had promised to meet him
      there; and he came slowly back, lingering and loitering, because this
      expected one had not yet made himself visible, yet plucked up a little
      alacrity as he drew near the house, because the communicant might have
      arrived in his absence, and be waiting for him in the dim library. It
      seemed as if he was under a spell; he could neither go away nor rest,&mdash;nothing
      but dreams, troubled dreams. He had ghostly fears, as if some one were
      near him whom he could not make out; stealing behind him, and starting
      away when he was impelled to turn round. A nervousness that his healthy
      temperament had never before permitted him to be the victim of, assailed
      him now. He could not help imputing it partly to the influence of the
      generations who had left a portion of their individual human nature in the
      house, which had become magnetic by them and could not rid itself of their
      presence in one sense, though, in another, they had borne it as far off as
      to where the gray tower of the village church rose above their remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, he was frightened to perceive what a hold the place was getting
      upon him; how the tendrils of the ivy seemed to hold him and would not let
      him go; how natural and homelike (grim and sombre as they were) the old
      doorways and apartments were becoming; how in no place that he had ever
      known had he had such a home-like feeling. To be sure, poor fellow, he had
      no earlier home except the almshouse, where his recollection of a fireside
      crowded by grim old women and pale, sickly children, of course never
      allowed him to have the reminiscences of a private, domestic home. But
      then there was the Doctor&rsquo;s home by the graveyard, and little Elsie, his
      constant playmate? No, even those recollections did not hold him like this
      heavy present circumstance. How should he ever draw himself away? No; the
      proud and vivid and active prospects that had heretofore spread themselves
      before him,&mdash;the striving to conquer, the struggle, the victory, the
      defeat, if such it was to be,&mdash;the experiences for good or ill,&mdash;the
      life, life, life,&mdash;all possibility of these was passing from him; all
      that hearty earnest contest or communion of man with man; and leaving him
      nothing but this great sombre shade, this brooding of the old family
      mansion, with its dreary ancestral hall, its mouldy dignity, its life of
      the past, its fettering honor, which to accept must bind him hand and
      foot, as respects all effort, such as he had trained himself for,&mdash;such
      as his own country offered. It was not any value for these,&mdash;as it
      seemed to Redclyffe,&mdash;but a witchcraft, an indefinable spell, a
      something that he could not define, that enthralled him, and was now doing
      a work on him analogous to, though different from, that which was wrought
      on Omskirk and all the other inhabitants, high and low, of this old
      mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt greatly interested in the master of the mansion; although perhaps
      it was not from anything in his nature; but partly because he conceived
      that he himself had a controlling power over his fortunes, and likewise
      from the vague perception of this before-mentioned trouble in him. It
      seemed, whatever it might be, to have converted an ordinary superficial
      man of the world into a being that felt and suffered inwardly, had pangs,
      fears, a conscience, a sense of unseen things. It seemed as if underneath
      this manor-house were the entrance to the cave of Trophonius, one visit to
      which made a man sad forever after; and that Lord Braithwaite had been
      there once, or perhaps went nightly, or at any hour. Or the mansion itself
      was like dark-colored experience, the reality; the point of view where
      things were seen in their true lights; the true world, all outside of
      which was delusion, and here&mdash;dreamlike as its structures seemed&mdash;the
      absolute truth. All those that lived in it were getting to be a
      brotherhood; and he among them; and perhaps before the blood-stained
      threshold would grow up an impassable barrier, which would cause himself
      to sit down in dreary quiet, like the rest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe, as has been intimated, had an unavowed&mdash;unavowed to
      himself&mdash;suspicion that the master of the house cherished no kindly
      purpose towards him; he had an indistinct feeling of danger from him; he
      would not have been surprised to know that he was concocting a plot
      against his life; and yet he did not think that Lord Braithwaite had the
      slightest hostility towards him. It might make the thing more horrible,
      perhaps; but it has been often seen in those who poison for the sake of
      interest, without feelings of personal malevolence, that they do it as
      kindly as the nature of the thing will permit; they, possibly, may even
      have a certain degree of affection for their victims, enough to induce
      them to make the last hours of life sweet and pleasant; to wind up the
      fever of life with a double supply of enjoyable throbs; to sweeten and
      delicately flavor the cup of death that they offer to the lips of him
      whose life is inconsistent with some stated necessity of their own. &ldquo;Dear
      friend,&rdquo; such a one might say to the friend whom he reluctantly condemned
      to death, &ldquo;think not that there is any base malice, any desire of pain to
      thee, that actuates me in this thing. Heaven knows, I earnestly wish thy
      good. But I have well considered the matter,&mdash;more deeply than thou
      hast,&mdash;and have found that it is essential that one thing should be,
      and essential to that thing that thou, my friend, shouldst die. Is that a
      doom which even thou wouldst object to with such an end to be answered?
      Thou art innocent; thou art not a man of evil life; the worst thing that
      can come of it, so far as thou art concerned, would be a quiet, endless
      repose in yonder churchyard, among dust of thy ancestry, with the English
      violets growing over thee there, and the green, sweet grass, which thou
      wilt not scorn to associate with thy dissolving elements, remembering that
      thy forefather owed a debt, for his own birth and growth, to this English
      soil, and paid it not,&mdash;consigned himself to that rough soil of
      another clime, under the forest leaves. Pay it, dear friend, without
      repining, and leave me to battle a little longer with this troublesome
      world, and in a few years to rejoin thee, and talk quietly over this
      matter which we are now arranging. How slight a favor, then, for one
      friend to do another, will seem this that I seek of thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe smiled to himself, as he thus gave expression to what he really
      half fancied were Lord Braithwaite&rsquo;s feelings and purposes towards him,
      and he felt them in the kindness and sweetness of his demeanor, and his
      evident wish to make him happy, combined with his own subtile suspicion of
      some design with which he had been invited here, or which had grown up
      since he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever has read Italian history must have seen such instances of this
      poisoning without malice or personal ill-feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own pleasant, companionable, perhaps noble traits and qualities, may
      have made a favorable impression on Lord Braithwaite, and perhaps he
      regretted the necessity of acting as he was about to do, but could not
      therefore weakly relinquish his deliberately formed design. And, on his
      part, Redclyffe bore no malice towards Lord Braithwaite, but felt really a
      kindly interest in him, and could he have made him happy at any less cost
      than his own life, or dearest interests, would perhaps have been glad to
      do so. He sometimes felt inclined to remonstrate with him in a friendly
      way; to tell him that his intended course was not likely to lead to a good
      result; that they had better try to arrange the matter on some other
      basis, and perhaps he would not find the American so unreasonable as he
      supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, it will be understood, were the mere dreamy suppositions of
      Redclyffe, in the idleness and languor of the old mansion, letting his
      mind run at will, and following it into dim caves, whither it tended. He
      did not actually believe anything of all this; unless it be a lawyer, or a
      policeman, or some very vulgar natural order of mind, no man really
      suspects another of crime. It is the hardest thing in the world for a
      noble nature&mdash;the hardest and the most shocking&mdash;to be convinced
      that a fellow-being is going to do a wrong thing, and the consciousness of
      one&rsquo;s own inviolability renders it still more difficult to believe that
      one&rsquo;s self is to be the object of the wrong. What he had been fancying
      looked to him like a romance. The strange part of the matter was, what
      suggested such a romance in regard to his kind and hospitable host, who
      seemed to exercise the hospitality of England with a kind of refinement
      and pleasant piquancy that came from his Italian mixture of blood? Was
      there no spiritual whisper here?
    </p>
    <p>
      So the time wore on; and Redclyffe began to be sensible that he must soon
      decide upon the course that he was to take; for his diplomatic position
      waited for him, and he could not loiter many days more away in this half
      delicious, half painful reverie and quiet in the midst of his struggling
      life. He was yet as undetermined what to do as ever; or, if we may come
      down to the truth, he was perhaps loath to acknowledge to himself the
      determination that he had actually formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, at dinner, which now came on after candle-light, he and Lord
      Braithwaite sat together at table, as usual, while Omskirk waited at the
      sideboard. It was a wild, gusty night, in which an autumnal breeze of
      later autumn seemed to have gone astray, and come into September
      intrusively. The two friends&mdash;for such we may call them&mdash;had
      spent a pleasant day together, wandering in the grounds, looking at the
      old house at all points, going to the church, and examining the
      cross-legged stone statues; they had ridden, too, and taken a great deal
      of healthful exercise, and had now that pleasant sense of just weariness
      enough which it is the boon of the climate of England to incite and permit
      men to take. Redclyffe was in one of his most genial moods, and Lord
      Braithwaite seemed to be the same; so kindly they were both disposed to
      one another, that the American felt that he might not longer refrain from
      giving his friend some light upon the character in which he appeared, or
      in which, at least, he had it at his option to appear. Lord Braithwaite
      might or might not know it already; but at all events it was his duty to
      tell him, or to take his leave, having thus far neither gained nor sought
      anything from their connection which would tend to forward his pursuit&mdash;should
      he decide to undertake it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cheerful fire, the rare wine, and the good fare had put them both
      into a good physical state, Redclyffe said to Lord Braithwaite,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a matter upon which I have been some time intending to speak to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Braithwaite nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A subject,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;of interest to both of us. Has it ever
      occurred to you, from the identity of name, that I may be really, what we
      have jokingly assumed me to be,&mdash;a relation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite, readily enough. &ldquo;The family would be
      proud to acknowledge such a kinsman, whose abilities and political rank
      would add a public lustre that it has long wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe bowed and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, I suppose, the annals of your house,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and have
      heard how, two centuries ago, or somewhat less, there was an ancestor who
      mysteriously disappeared. He was never seen again. There were tales of
      private murder, out of which a hundred legends have come down to these
      days, as I have myself found, though most of them in so strange a shape
      that I should hardly know them, had I not myself a clue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard some of these legends,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you ever hear, among them,&rdquo; asked Redclyffe, &ldquo;that the lost
      ancestor did not really die,&mdash;was not murdered,&mdash;but lived long,
      though in another hemisphere,&mdash;lived long, and left heirs behind
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is such a legend,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left posterity,&rdquo; continued Redclyffe,&mdash;&ldquo;a representative of whom is
      alive at this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I have not known, though I might conjecture something like it,&rdquo; said
      Braithwaite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coolness with which he took this perplexed Redclyffe. He resolved to
      make trial at once whether it were possible to move him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have reason to believe,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that that representative is
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should that prove to be the case, you are welcome back to your own,&rdquo; said
      Lord Braithwaite, quietly. &ldquo;It will be a very remarkable case, if the
      proofs for two hundred years, or thereabouts, can be so distinctly made
      out as to nullify the claim of one whose descent is undoubted. Yet it is
      certainly not impossible. I suppose it would hardly be fair in me to ask
      what are your proofs, and whether I may see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The documents are in the hands of my agents in London,&rdquo; replied
      Redclyffe; &ldquo;and seem to be ample, among them being a certified genealogy
      from the first emigrant downward, without a break. A declaration of two
      men of note among the first settlers, certifying that they knew the first
      emigrant, under a change of name, to be the eldest son of the house of
      Braithwaite; full proofs, at least on that head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a lawyer, I believe,&rdquo; said Braithwaite, &ldquo;and know better than I
      what may be necessary to prove your claim. I will frankly own to you, that
      I have heard, long ago,&mdash;as long as when my connection with this
      hereditary property first began,&mdash;that there was supposed to be an
      heir extant for a long course of years, and that there, was no proof that
      that main line of the descent had ever become extinct. If these things had
      come fairly before me, and been represented to me with whatever force
      belongs to them, before my accession to the estate,&mdash;these and other
      facts which I have since become acquainted with,&mdash;I might have
      deliberated on the expediency of coming to such a doubtful possession. The
      property, I assure you, is not so desirable that, taking all things into
      consideration, it has much increased my happiness. But, now, here I am,
      having paid a price in a certain way,&mdash;which you will understand, if
      you ever come into the property,&mdash;a price of a nature that cannot
      possibly be refunded. It can hardly be presumed that I shall see your
      right a moment sooner than you make it manifest by law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neither expect nor wish it,&rdquo; replied Redclyffe, &ldquo;nor, to speak frankly,
      am I quite sure that you will ever have occasion to defend your title, or
      to question mine. When I came hither, to be your guest, it was almost with
      the settled purpose never to mention my proofs, nor to seek to make them
      manifest. That purpose is not, I may say, yet relinquished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I am to infer from your words that it is shaken?&rdquo; said Braithwaite.
      &ldquo;You find the estate, then, so delightful,&mdash;this life of the old
      manor-house so exquisitely agreeable,&mdash;this air so cheering,&mdash;this
      moral atmosphere so invigorating,&mdash;that your scruples are about
      coming to an end. You think this life of an Englishman, this fair prospect
      of a title, so irresistibly enticing as to be worth more than your claim,
      in behalf of your American birthright, to a possible Presidency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sort of sneer in this, which Redclyffe did not well know how
      to understand; and there was a look on Braithwaite&rsquo;s face, as he said it,
      that made him think of a condemned soul, who should be dressed in
      magnificent robes, and surrounded with the mockery of state, splendor, and
      happiness, who, if he should be congratulated on his fortunate and
      blissful situation, would probably wear just such a look, and speak in
      just that tone. He looked a moment in Braithwaite&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I do not think that there is much happiness in it. A
      brighter, healthier, more useful, far more satisfactory, though tumultuous
      life would await me in my own country. But there is about this place a
      strange, deep, sad, brooding interest, which possesses me, and draws me to
      it, and will not let me go. I feel as if, in spite of myself and my most
      earnest efforts, I were fascinated by something in the spot, and must
      needs linger here, and make it my home if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be welcome; the old hereditary chair will be filled at last,&rdquo;
       said Braithwaite, pointing to the vacant chair. &ldquo;Come, we will drink to
      you in a cup of welcome. Take the old chair now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In half-frolic Redclyffe took the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called to Omskirk to bring a bottle of a particularly exquisite Italian
      wine, known only to the most deeply skilled in the vintages of that
      country, and which, he said, was oftener heard of than seen,&mdash;oftener
      seen than tasted. Omskirk put it on the table in its original glass, and
      Braithwaite filled Redclyffe&rsquo;s glass and his own, and raised the latter to
      his lips, with a frank expression of his mobile countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May you have a secure possession of your estate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and live long
      in the midst of your possessions. To me, on the whole, it seems better
      than your American prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe thanked him, and drank off the glass of wine, which was not very
      much to his taste; as new varieties of wine are apt not to be. All the
      conversation that had passed had been in a free, careless sort of way,
      without apparently much earnestness in it; for they were both men who knew
      how to keep their more serious parts within them. But Redclyffe was glad
      that the explanation was over, and that he might now remain at
      Braithwaite&rsquo;s table, under his roof, without that uneasy feeling of
      treachery which, whether rightly or not, had haunted him hitherto. He felt
      joyous, and stretched his hand out for the bottle which Braithwaite kept
      near himself, instead of passing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not yourself do justice to your own favorite wine,&rdquo; observed
      Redclyffe, seeing his host&rsquo;s full glass standing before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have filled again,&rdquo; said Braithwaite, carelessly; &ldquo;but I know not that
      I shall venture to drink a second glass. It is a wine that does not bear
      mixture with other vintages, though of most genial and admirable qualities
      when taken by itself. Drink your own, however, for it will be a rare
      occasion indeed that would induce me to offer you another bottle of this
      rare stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe sipped his second glass, endeavoring to find out what was this
      subtile and peculiar flavor that hid itself so, and yet seemed on the
      point of revealing itself. It had, he thought, a singular effect upon his
      faculties, quickening and making them active, and causing him to feel as
      if he were on the point of penetrating rare mysteries, such as men&rsquo;s
      thoughts are always hovering round, and always returning from. Some
      strange, vast, sombre, mysterious truth, which he seemed to have searched
      for long, appeared to be on the point of being revealed to him; a sense of
      something to come; something to happen that had been waiting long, long to
      happen; an opening of doors, a drawing away of veils; a lifting of heavy,
      magnificent curtains, whose dark folds hung before a spectacle of awe;&mdash;it
      was like the verge of the grave. Whether it was the exquisite wine of
      Braithwaite, or whatever it might be, the American felt a strange
      influence upon him, as if he were passing through the gates of eternity,
      and finding on the other side the revelation of some secret that had
      greatly perplexed him on this side. He thought that Braithwaite&rsquo;s face
      assumed a strange, subtile smile,&mdash;not malicious, yet crafty,
      triumphant, and at the same time terribly sad, and with that perception
      his senses, his life, welled away; and left him in the deep ancestral
      chair at the board of Braithwaite.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When awake [Endnote: 1], or beginning to awake, he lay for some time in a
      maze; not a disagreeable one, but thoughts were running to and fro in his
      mind, all mixed and jumbled together. Reminiscences of early days, even
      those that were Preadamite; referring, we mean, to those times in the
      almshouse, which he could not at ordinary times remember at all; but now
      there seemed to be visions of old women and men, and pallid girls, and
      little dirty boys, which could only be referred to that epoch. Also, and
      most vividly, there was the old Doctor, with his sternness, his
      fierceness, his mystery; and all that happened since, playing
      phantasmagoria before his yet unclosed eyes; nor, so mysterious was his
      state, did he know, when he should unclose those lids, where he should
      find himself. He was content to let the world go on in this way, as long
      as it would, and therefore did not hurry, but rather kept back the proofs
      of awakening; willing to look at the scenes that were unrolling for his
      amusement, as it seemed; and willing, too, to keep it uncertain whether he
      were not back in America, and in his boyhood, and all other subsequent
      impressions a dream or a prophetic vision. But at length something
      stirring near him,&mdash;or whether it stirred, or whether he dreamed it,
      he could not quite tell,&mdash;but the uncertainty impelled him, at last,
      to open his eyes, and see whereabouts he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then he continued in as much uncertainty as he was before, and lay
      with marvellous quietude in it, trying sluggishly to make the mystery out.
      It was in a dim, twilight place, wherever it might be; a place of
      half-awakeness, where the outlines of things were not well defined; but it
      seemed to be a chamber, antique and vaulted, narrow and high, hung round
      with old tapestry. Whether it were morning or midday he could not tell,
      such was the character of the light, nor even where it came from; for
      there appeared to be no windows, and yet it was not apparently artificial
      light; nor light at all, indeed, but a gray dimness. It was so like his
      own half-awake state that he lay in it a longer time, not incited to
      finish his awaking, but in a languor, not disagreeable, yet hanging
      heavily, heavily upon him, like a dark pall. It was, in fact, as if he had
      been asleep for years, or centuries, or till the last day was dawning, and
      then was collecting his thoughts in such slow fashion as would then be
      likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that noise,&mdash;a little, low, quiet sound, as of one breathing
      somewhere near him. The whole thing was very much like that incident which
      introduced him to the Hospital, and his first coming to his senses there;
      and he almost fancied that some such accident must again have happened to
      him, and that when his sight cleared he should again behold the venerable
      figure of the pensioner. With this idea he let his head steady itself; and
      it seemed to him that its dizziness must needs be the result of very long
      and deep sleep. What if it were the sleep of a century? What if all things
      that were extant when he went to sleep had passed away, and he was waking
      now in another epoch of time? Where was America, and the republic in which
      he hoped for such great things? Where England? had she stood it better
      than the republic? Was the old Hospital still in being,&mdash;although the
      good Warden must long since have passed out of his warm and pleasant life?
      And himself, how came he to be preserved? In what musty old nook had he
      been put away, where Time neglected and Death forgot him, until now he was
      to get up friendless, helpless,&mdash;when new heirs had come to the
      estate he was on the point of laying claim to,&mdash;and go onward through
      what remained of life? Would it not have been better to have lived with
      his contemporaries, and to be now dead and dust with them? Poor, petty
      interests of a day, how slight!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the noise, a little stir, a sort of quiet moan, or something that he
      could not quite define; but it seemed, whenever he heard it, as if some
      fact thrust itself through the dream-work with which he was circumfused;
      something alien to his fantasies, yet not powerful enough to dispel them.
      It began to be irksome to him, this little sound of something near him;
      and he thought, in the space of another hundred years, if it continued, he
      should have to arouse himself and see what it was. But, indeed, there was
      something so cheering in this long repose,&mdash;this rest from all the
      troubles of earth, which it sometimes seems as if only a churchyard bed
      would give us,&mdash;that he wished the noise would let him alone. But his
      thoughts were gradually getting too busy for this slumberous state. He
      begun, perforce, to come nearer actuality. The strange question occurred
      to him, Had any time at all passed? Was he not still sitting at Lord
      Braithwaite&rsquo;s table, having just now quaffed a second glass of that rare
      and curious Italian wine? Was it not affecting his head very strangely,&mdash;so
      that he was put out of time as it were? He would rally himself, and try to
      set his head right with another glass. He must be still at table, for now
      he remembered he had not gone to bed at all. [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, the noise! He could not bear it, he would awake now, now!&mdash;silence
      it, and then to sleep again. In fact, he started up; started to his feet,
      in puzzle and perplexity, and stood gazing around him, with swimming
      brain. It was an antique room, which he did not at all recognize, and,
      indeed, in that dim twilight&mdash;which how it came he could not tell&mdash;he
      could scarcely discern what were its distinguishing marks. But he seemed
      to be sensible, that, in a high-backed chair, at a little distance from
      him, sat a figure in a long robe; a figure of a man with snow-white hair
      and a long beard, who seemed to be gazing at him, quietly, as if he had
      been gazing a hundred years. I know not what it was, but there was an
      influence as if this old man belonged to some other age and category of
      man than he was now amongst. He remembered the old family legend of the
      existence of an ancestor two or three centuries in age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the old family personified,&rdquo; thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old figure made no sign, but continued to sit gazing at him in so
      strangely still a manner that it made Redclyffe shiver with something that
      seemed like affright. There was an aspect of long, long time about him; as
      if he had never been young, or so long ago as when the world was young
      along with him. He might be the demon of this old house; the
      representative of all that happened in it, the grief, the long languor and
      weariness of life, the deaths, gathering them all into himself, and
      figuring them in furrows, wrinkles, and white hairs,&mdash;a being that
      might have been young, when those old Saxon timbers were put together,
      with the oaks that were saplings when Caesar landed, and was in his
      maturity when the Conqueror came, and was now lapsing into extreme age
      when the nineteenth century was elderly. His garb might have been of any
      time, that long, loose robe that enveloped him. Redclyffe remained in this
      way, gazing at this aged figure; at first without the least wonder, but
      calmly, as we feel in dreams, when, being in a land of enchantment, we
      take everything as if it were a matter of course, and feel, by the right
      of our own marvellous nature, on terms of equal kindred with all other
      marvels. So it was with him when he first became aware of the old man,
      sitting there with that age-long regard directed towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, by degrees, a sense of wonder had its will, and grew, slowly at
      first, in Redclyffe&rsquo;s mind; and almost twin-born with it, and growing
      piece by piece, there was a sense of awful fear, as his waking senses came
      slowly back to him. In the dreamy state, he had felt no fear; but, as a
      waking man, it was fearful to discover that the shadowy forms did not fly
      from his awaking eyes. He started at last to his feet from the low couch
      on which he had all this time been lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old figure made no answer; nor could Redclyffe be quite sure that his
      voice had any effect upon it, though he fancied that it was shaken a
      little, as if his voice came to it from afar. But it continued to gaze at
      him, or at least to have its aged face turned towards him in the dim
      light; and this strange composure, and unapproachableness, were very
      frightful. As his manhood gathered about his heart, however, the American
      endeavored to shake off this besetting fear, or awe, or whatever it was;
      and to bring himself to a sense of waking things,&mdash;to burst through
      the mist and delusive shows that bewildered him, and catch hold of a
      reality. He stamped upon the floor; it was solid stone, the pavement, or
      oak so old and stanch that it resembled it. There was one firm thing,
      therefore. But the contrast between this and the slipperiness, the
      unaccountableness, of the rest of his position, made him the more sensible
      of the latter. He made a step towards the old figure; another; another. He
      was face to face with him, within a yard of distance. He saw the faint
      movement of the old man&rsquo;s breath; he sought, through the twilight of the
      room, some glimmer of perception in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a living man?&rdquo; asked Redclyffe, faintly and doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mumbled, the old figure, some faint moaning sound, that, if it were
      language at all, had all the edges and angles worn off it by decay,&mdash;unintelligible,
      except that it seemed to signify a faint mournfulness and complainingness
      of mood; and then held his peace, continuing to gaze as before. Redclyffe
      could not bear the awe that filled him, while he kept at a distance, and,
      coming desperately forward, he stood close to the old figure; he touched
      his robe, to see if it were real; he laid his hand upon the withered hand
      that held the staff, in which he now recognized the very staff of the
      Doctor&rsquo;s legend. His fingers touched a real hand, though, bony and dry, as
      if it had been in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are real?&rdquo; said Redclyffe doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old figure seemed to have exhausted itself&mdash;its energies, what
      there were of them&mdash;in the effort of making the unintelligible
      communication already vouchsafed. Then he seemed to lapse out of
      consciousness, and not to know what was passing, or to be sensible that
      any person was near him. But Redclyffe was now resuming his firmness and
      daylight consciousness even in the dimness. He ran over all that he had
      heard of the legend of the old house, rapidly considering whether there
      might not be something of fact in the legend of the undying old man;
      whether, as told or whispered in the chimney-corners, it might not be an
      instance of the mysterious, the half-spiritual mode, in which actual
      truths communicate themselves imperfectly through a medium that gives them
      the aspect of falsehood. Something in the atmosphere of the house made its
      inhabitants and neighbors dimly aware that there was a secret resident; it
      was by a language not audible, but of impression; there could not be such
      a secret in its recesses, without making itself sensible. This legend of
      the undying one translated it to vulgar apprehension. He remembered those
      early legends, told by the Doctor, in his childhood; he seemed imperfectly
      and doubtfully to see what was their true meaning, and how, taken aright,
      they had a reality, and were the craftily concealed history of his own
      wrongs, sufferings, and revenge. And this old man! who was he? He joined
      the Warden&rsquo;s account of the family to the Doctor&rsquo;s legends. He could not
      believe, or take thoroughly in, the strange surmise to which they led him;
      but, by an irresistible impulse, he acted on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Edward Redclyffe!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! who speaks to me?&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, in a startled voice, like
      one who hears himself called at an unexpected moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Edward Redclyffe,&rdquo; repeated Redclyffe, &ldquo;I bring you news of Norman
      Oglethorpe!&rdquo; [Endnote: 3.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The villain! the tyrant! mercy! mercy! save me!&rdquo; cried the old man, in
      most violent emotion of terror and rage intermixed, that shook his old
      frame as if it would be shaken asunder. He stood erect, the picture of
      ghastly horror, as if he saw before him that stern face that had thrown a
      blight over his life, and so fearfully avenged, from youth to age, the
      crime that he had committed. The effect, the passion, was too much,&mdash;the
      terror with which it smote, the rage that accompanied it, blazed up for a
      moment with a fierce flame, then flickered and went out. He stood
      tottering; Redclyffe put out his hand to support him; but he sank down in
      a heap on the floor, as if a thing of dry bones had been suddenly loosened
      at the joints, and fell in a rattling heap. [Endnote: 4.]

      Redclyffe, apparently, had not communicated to his agent in London his
      change of address, when he left the Warden&rsquo;s residence to avail himself of
      the hospitality of Braithwaite Hall; for letters arrived for him, from his
      own country, both private and with the seal of state upon them; one among
      the rest that bore on the envelope the name of the President of the United
      States. The good Warden was impressed with great respect for so
      distinguished a signature, and, not knowing but that the welfare of the
      Republic (for which he had an Englishman&rsquo;s contemptuous interest) might be
      involved in its early delivery at its destination, he determined to ride
      over to Braithwaite Hall, call on his friend, and deliver it with his own
      hand. With this purpose, he mounted his horse, at the hour of his usual
      morning ride, and set forth; and, before reaching the village, saw a
      figure before him which he recognized as that of the pensioner. [Endnote:

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soho! whither go you, old friend?&rdquo; said the Warden, drawing his bridle as
      he came up with the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Braithwaite Hall, sir,&rdquo; said the pensioner, who continued to walk
      diligently on; &ldquo;and I am glad to see your honor (if it be so) on the same
      errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked the Warden. &ldquo;You seem much in earnest. Why should my visit
      to Braithwaite Hall be a special cause of rejoicing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the pensioner, &ldquo;your honor is specially interested in this
      young American, who has gone thither to abide; and when one is in a
      strange country he needs some guidance. My mind is not easy about the
      young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Warden, smiling to himself at the old gentleman&rsquo;s idle
      and senile fears, &ldquo;I commend your diligence on behalf of your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rode on as he spoke, and deep in one of the woodland paths he saw the
      flutter of a woman&rsquo;s garment, and, greatly to his surprise, overtook
      Elsie, who seemed to be walking along with great rapidity, and, startled
      by the approach of hoofs behind her, looked up at him, with a pale cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Miss Elsie,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;You are taking a long walk
      this morning. I regret to see that I have frightened you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, whither are you going?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Hall,&rdquo; said the Warden, wondering at the abrupt question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Elsie, &ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, pray insist on seeing Mr.
      Redclyffe,&mdash;take no excuse. There are reasons for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, fair lady,&rdquo; responded the Warden, wondering more and more at
      this injunction from such a source. &ldquo;And when I see this fascinating
      gentleman, pray what message am I to give him from Miss Elsie,&mdash;who,
      moreover, seems to be on the eve of visiting him in person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See him! see him! Only see him!&rdquo; said Elsie, with passionate earnestness,
      &ldquo;and in haste! See him now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waved him onward as she spoke; and the Warden, greatly commoted for
      the nonce, complied with the maiden&rsquo;s fantasy so far as to ride on at a
      quicker pace, uneasily marvelling at what could have aroused this usually
      shy and reserved girl&rsquo;s nervousness to such a pitch. The incident served
      at all events to titillate his English sluggishness; so that he approached
      the avenue of the old Hall with a vague expectation of something that had
      happened there, though he knew not of what nature it could possibly be.
      However, he rode round to the side entrance, by which horsemen generally
      entered the house, and, a groom approaching to take his bridle, he
      alighted and approached the door. I know not whether it were anything more
      than the glistening moisture common in an English autumnal morning; but so
      it was, that the trace of the Bloody Footstep seemed fresh, as if it had
      been that very night imprinted anew, and the crime made all over again,
      with fresh guilt upon somebody&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the footman came to the door, responsive to his ring, the Warden
      inquired for Mr. Redclyffe, the American gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American gentleman left for London, early this morning,&rdquo; replied the
      footman, in a matter-of-fact way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; exclaimed the Warden. &ldquo;This is sudden; and strange that he should
      go without saying good by. Gone,&rdquo; and then he remembered the old
      pensioner&rsquo;s eagerness that the Warden should come here, and Elsie&rsquo;s
      strange injunction that he should insist on seeing Redclyffe. &ldquo;Pray, is
      Lord Braithwaite at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, he is in the library,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;but will see;
      pray, sir, walk in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned in a moment, and ushered the Warden through passages with
      which he was familiar of old, to the library, where he found Lord
      Braithwaite sitting with the London newspaper in his hand. He rose and
      welcomed his guest with great equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Warden&rsquo;s inquiries after Redclyffe, Lord Braithwaite replied that
      his guest had that morning left the house, being called to London by
      letters from America; but of what nature Lord Braithwaite was unable to
      say, except that they seemed to be of urgency and importance. The Warden&rsquo;s
      further inquiries, which he pushed as far as was decorous, elicited
      nothing more than this; and he was preparing to take his leave,&mdash;not
      seeing any reason for insisting (according to Elsie&rsquo;s desire) on the
      impossibility of seeing a man who was not there,&mdash;nor, indeed, any
      reason for so doing. And yet it seemed very strange that Redclyffe should
      have gone so unceremoniously; nor was he half satisfied, though he knew
      not why he should be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to know Mr. Redclyffe&rsquo;s address in London,&rdquo; asked the
      Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Braithwaite. &ldquo;But I presume there is courtesy enough in
      the American character to impel him to write to me, or both of us, within
      a day or two, telling us of his whereabouts and whatabouts. Should you
      know, I beg you will let me know; for I have really been pleased with this
      gentleman, and should have been glad could he have favored me with a
      somewhat longer visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more to be said; and the Warden took his leave, and was
      about mounting his horse, when he beheld the pensioner approaching the
      house, and he remained standing until he should come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too late,&rdquo; said he, as the old man drew near. &ldquo;Our friend has
      taken French leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Warden,&rdquo; said the old man solemnly, &ldquo;let me pray you not to give him
      up so easily. Come with me into the presence of Lord Braithwaite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Warden made some objections; but the pensioner&rsquo;s manner was so
      earnest, that he soon consented; knowing that the strangeness of his
      sudden return might well enough be put upon the eccentricities of the
      pensioner, especially as he was so well known to Lord Braithwaite. He
      accordingly again rang at the door, which being opened by the same stolid
      footman, the Warden desired him to announce to Lord Braithwaite that the
      Warden and a pensioner desired to see him. He soon returned, with a
      request that they would walk in, and ushered them again to the library,
      where they found the master of the house in conversation with Omskirk at
      one end of the apartment,&mdash;a whispered conversation, which detained
      him a moment, after their arrival. The Warden fancied that he saw in old
      Omskirk&rsquo;s countenance a shade more of that mysterious horror which made
      him such a bugbear to children; but when Braithwaite turned from him and
      approached his visitor, there was no trace of any disturbance, beyond a
      natural surprise to see his good friend the Warden so soon after his
      taking leave. [Endnote: 2.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are surprised,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;But you must lay the blame,
      if any, on our good old friend here, who, for some reason, best known to
      himself, insisted on having my company here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Braithwaite looked to the old pensioner, with a questioning look, as if
      good-humoredly (yet not as if he cared much about it) asking for an
      explanation. As Omskirk was about leaving the room, having remained till
      this time, with that nervous look which distinguished him gazing towards
      the party, the pensioner made him a sign, which he obeyed as if compelled
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friend,&rdquo; said the Warden, somewhat impatient of the aspect in
      which he himself appeared, &ldquo;I beg of you, explain at once to Lord
      Braithwaite why you have brought me back in this strange way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said the pensioner quietly, &ldquo;that in your presence I request him
      to allow me to see Mr. Redclyffe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my friend,&rdquo; said Braithwaite, &ldquo;how can I show you a man who has left
      my house, and whom in the chances of this life, I am not very likely to
      see again, though hospitably desirous of so doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here ensued a laughing sort of colloquy between the Warden and
      Braithwaite, in which the former jocosely excused himself for having
      yielded to the whim of the pensioner, and returned with him on an errand
      which he well knew to be futile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long been aware,&rdquo; he said apart, in a confidential way, &ldquo;of
      something a little awry in our old friend&rsquo;s mental system. You will excuse
      him, and me for humoring him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said Braithwaite, in the same tone. &ldquo;I shall not
      be moved by anything the old fellow can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old pensioner, meanwhile, had been as it were heating up, and
      gathering himself into a mood of energy which those who saw him had never
      before witnessed in his usually quiet person. He seemed somehow to grow
      taller and larger, more impressive. At length, fixing his eyes on Lord
      Braithwaite, he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dark, murderous man,&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Your course has not been unwatched;
      the secrets of this mansion are not unknown. For two centuries back, they
      have been better known to them who dwell afar off than to those resident
      within the mansion. The foot that made the Bloody Footstep has returned
      from its long wanderings, and it passes on, straight as destiny,&mdash;sure
      as an avenging Providence,&mdash;to the punishment and destruction of
      those who incur retribution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is an odd kind of tragedy,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite, with a scornful
      smile. &ldquo;Come, my old friend, lay aside this vein and talk sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not thus do you escape your penalty, hardened and crafty one!&rdquo; exclaimed
      the pensioner. &ldquo;I demand of you, before this worthy Warden, access to the
      secret ways of this mansion, of which thou dost unjustly retain
      possession. I shall disclose what for centuries has remained hidden,&mdash;the
      ghastly secrets that this house hides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humor him,&rdquo; whispered the Warden, &ldquo;and hereafter I will take care that
      the exuberance of our old friend shall be duly restrained. He shall not
      trouble you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Braithwaite, to say the truth, appeared a little flabbergasted and
      disturbed by these latter expressions of the old gentleman. He hesitated,
      turned pale; but at last, recovering his momentary confusion and
      irresolution, he replied, with apparent carelessness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go wherever you will, old gentleman. The house is open to you for this
      time. If ever you have another opportunity to disturb it, the fault will
      be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow, sir,&rdquo; said the pensioner, turning to the Warden; &ldquo;follow,
      maiden![Endnote: 3] Now shall a great mystery begin to be revealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he led the way before them, passing out of the hall, not by the
      doorway, but through one of the oaken panels of the wall, which admitted
      the party into a passage which seemed to pass through the thickness of the
      wall, and was lighted by interstices through which shone gleams of light.
      This led them into what looked like a little vestibule, or circular room,
      which the Warden, though deeming himself many years familiar with the old
      house, had never seen before, any more than the passage which led to it.
      To his surprise, this room was not vacant, for in it sat, in a large old
      chair, Omskirk, like a toad in its hole, like some wild, fearful creature
      in its den, and it was now partly understood how this man had the
      possibility of suddenly disappearing, so inscrutably, and so in a moment;
      and, when all quest for him was given up, of as suddenly appearing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said old Omskirk, slowly rising, as at the approach of some event
      that he had long expected. &ldquo;Is he coming at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor victim of another&rsquo;s iniquity,&rdquo; said the pensioner. &ldquo;Thy release
      approaches. Rejoice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man arose with a sort of trepidation and solemn joy intermixed in
      his manner, and bowed reverently, as if there were in what he heard more
      than other ears could understand in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have waited long,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Welcome; if my release is come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lord Braithwaite, scornfully. &ldquo;This secret retreat of my
      house is known to many. It was the priest&rsquo;s secret chamber when it was
      dangerous to be of the old and true religion, here in England. There is no
      longer any use in concealing this place; and the Warden, or any man, might
      have seen it, or any of the curiosities of the old hereditary house, if
      desirous so to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! son of Belial!&rdquo; quoth the pensioner. &ldquo;And this, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took three pieces from a certain point of the wall, which he seemed to
      know, and stooped to press upon the floor. The Warden looked at Lord
      Braithwaite, and saw that he had grown deadly pale. What his change of
      cheer might bode, he could not guess; but, at the pressure of the old
      pensioner&rsquo;s finger, the floor, or a segment of it, rose like the lid of a
      box, and discovered a small darksome pair of stairs, within which burned a
      lamp, lighting it downward, like the steps that descend into a sepulchre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow,&rdquo; said he, to those who looked on, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he began to descend. Lord Braithwaite saw him disappear, then
      frantically followed, the Warden next, and old Omskirk took his place in
      the rear, like a man following his inevitable destiny. At the bottom of a
      winding descent, that seemed deep and remote, and far within, they came to
      a door, which the pensioner pressed with a spring; and, passing through
      the space that disclosed itself, the whole party followed, and found
      themselves in a small, gloomy room. On one side of it was a couch, on
      which sat Redclyffe; face to face with him was a white-haired figure in a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are come!&rdquo; said Redclyffe, solemnly. &ldquo;But too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yonder is the coffer,&rdquo; said the pensioner. &ldquo;Open but that; and our
      quest is ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, if I mistake not, I can do,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew forth&mdash;what he had kept all this time, as something that
      might yet reveal to him the mystery of his birth&mdash;the silver key that
      had been found by the grave in far New England; and applying it to the
      lock, he slowly turned it on the hinges, that had not been turned for two
      hundred years. All&mdash;even Lord Braithwaite, guilty and shame-stricken
      as he felt&mdash;pressed forward to look upon what was about to be
      disclosed. What were the wondrous contents? The entire, mysterious coffer
      was full of golden ringlets, abundant, clustering through the whole
      coffer, and living with elasticity, so as immediately, as it were, to flow
      over the sides of the coffer, and rise in large abundance from the long
      compression. Into this&mdash;by a miracle of natural production which was
      known likewise in other cases&mdash;into this had been resolved the whole
      bodily substance of that fair and unfortunate being, known so long in the
      legends of the family as the Beauty of the Golden Locks. As the pensioner
      looked at this strange sight,&mdash;the lustre of the precious and
      miraculous hair gleaming and glistening, and seeming to add light to the
      gloomy room,&mdash;he took from his breast pocket another lock of hair, in
      a locket, and compared it, before their faces, with that which brimmed
      over from the coffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are you that know it?&rdquo; asked Redclyffe, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He whose ancestors taught him the secret,&mdash;who has had it handed
      down to him these two centuries, and now only with regret yields to the
      necessity of making it known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the heir!&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that gloomy room, beside the dead old man, they looked at him, and saw
      a dignity beaming on him, covering his whole figure, that broke out like a
      lustre at the close of day.

    <p>
      <i>Note 5.</i> In order to show the manner in which Hawthorne would modify
      a passage, which was nevertheless to be left substantially the same, I
      subjoin here a description of this graveyard as it appears in the earlier
      draft: &ldquo;The graveyard (we are sorry to have to treat of such a
      disagreeable piece of ground, but everybody&rsquo;s business centres there at
      one time or another) was the most ancient in the town. The dust of the
      original Englishmen had become incorporated with the soil; of those
      Englishmen whose immediate predecessors had been resolved into the earth
      about the country churches,&mdash;the little Norman, square, battlemented
      stone towers of the villages in the old land; so that in this point of
      view, as holding bones and dust of the first ancestors, this graveyard was
      more English than anything else in town. There had been hidden from sight
      many a broad, bluff visage of husbandmen that had ploughed the real
      English soil; there the faces of noted men, now known in history; there
      many a personage whom tradition told about, making wondrous qualities of
      strength and courage for him;&mdash;all these, mingled with succeeding
      generations, turned up and battened down again with the sexton&rsquo;s spade;
      until every blade of grass was human more than vegetable,&mdash;for an
      hundred and fifty years will do this, and so much time, at least, had
      elapsed since the first little mound was piled up in the virgin soil. Old
      tombs there were too, with numerous sculptures on them; and quaint, mossy
      gravestones; although all kinds of monumental appendages were of a date
      more recent than the time of the first settlers, who had been content with
      wooden memorials, if any, the sculptor&rsquo;s art not having then reached New
      England. Thus rippled, surged, broke almost against the house, this dreary
      graveyard, which made the street gloomy, so that people did not like to
      pass the dark, high wooden fence, with its closed gate, that separated it
      from the street. And this old house was one that crowded upon it, and took
      up the ground that would otherwise have been sown as thickly with dead as
      the rest of the lot; so that it seemed hardly possible but that the dead
      people should get up out of their graves, and come in there to warm
      themselves. But in truth, I have never heard a whisper of its being
      haunted.&rdquo;

      <i>Note 3.</i> These two children are described as follows in an early
      note of the author&rsquo;s: &ldquo;The boy had all the qualities fitted to excite
      tenderness in those who had the care of him; in the first and most evident
      place, on account of his personal beauty, which was very remarkable,&mdash;the
      most intelligent and expressive face that can be conceived, changing in
      those early years like an April day, and beautiful in all its changes;
      dark, but of a soft expression, kindling, melting, glowing, laughing; a
      varied intelligence, which it was as good as a book to read. He was quick
      in all modes of mental exercise; quick and strong, too, in sensibility;
      proud, and gifted (probably by the circumstances in which he was placed)
      with an energy which the softness and impressibility of his nature needed.&mdash;As
      for the little girl, all the squalor of the abode served but to set off
      her lightsomeness and brightsomeness. She was a pale, large-eyed little
      thing, and it might have been supposed that the air of the house and the
      contiguity of the burial-place had a bad effect upon her health. Yet I
      hardly think this could have been the case, for she was of a very airy
      nature, dancing and sporting through the house as if melancholy had never
      been made. She took all kinds of childish liberties with the Doctor, and
      with his pipe, and with everything appertaining to him except his spiders
      and his cobwebs.&rdquo;&mdash;All of which goes to show that Hawthorne first
      conceived his characters in the mood of the &ldquo;Twice-Told Tales,&rdquo; and then
      by meditation solidified them to the inimitable flesh-and-blood of &ldquo;The
      House of the Seven Gables&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Blithedale Romance.&rdquo;

      CHAP. IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Note 1.</i> The Doctor&rsquo;s propensity for cobwebs is amplified in the
      following note for an earlier and somewhat milder version of the
      character: &ldquo;According to him, all science was to be renewed and
      established on a sure ground by no other means than cobwebs. The cobweb
      was the magic clue by which mankind was to be rescued from all its errors,
      and guided safely back to the right. And so he cherished spiders above all
      things, and kept them spinning, spinning away; the only textile factory
      that existed at that epoch in New England. He distinguished the production
      of each of his ugly friends, and assigned peculiar qualities to each; and
      he had been for years engaged in writing a work on this new discovery, in
      reference to which he had already compiled a great deal of folio
      manuscript, and had unguessed at resources still to come. With this
      suggestive subject he interwove all imaginable learning, collected from
      his own library, rich in works that few others had read, and from that of
      his beloved University, crabbed with Greek, rich with Latin, drawing into
      itself, like a whirlpool, all that men had thought hitherto, and combining
      them anew in such a way that it had all the charm of a racy originality.
      Then he had projects for the cultivation of cobwebs, to which end, in the
      good Doctor&rsquo;s opinion, it seemed desirable to devote a certain part of the
      national income; and not content with this, all public-spirited citizens
      would probably be induced to devote as much of their time and means as
      they could to the same end. According to him, there was no such beautiful
      festoon and drapery for the halls of princes as the spinning of this
      heretofore despised and hated insect; and by due encouragement it might be
      hoped that they would flourish, and hang and dangle and wave triumphant in
      the breeze, to an extent as yet generally undreamed of. And he lamented
      much the destruction that has heretofore been wrought upon this precious
      fabric by the housemaid&rsquo;s broom, and insisted upon by foolish women who
      claimed to be good housewives. Indeed, it was the general opinion that the
      Doctor&rsquo;s celibacy was in great measure due to the impossibility of finding
      a woman who would pledge herself to co-operate with him in this great
      ambition of his life,&mdash;that of reducing the world to a cobweb
      factory; or who would bind herself to let her own drawing-room be
      ornamented with this kind of tapestry. But there never was a wife
      precisely fitted for our friend the Doctor, unless it had been Arachne
      herself, to whom, if she could again have been restored to her female
      shape, he would doubtless have lost no time in paying his addresses. It
      was doubtless the having dwelt too long among the musty and dusty clutter
      and litter of things gone by, that made the Doctor almost a monomaniac on
      this subject. There were cobwebs in his own brain, and so he saw nothing
      valuable but cobwebs in the world around him; and deemed that the march of
      created things, up to this time, had been calculated by foreknowledge to
      produce them.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <i>Note 1.</i> The following passage, though it seems to fit in here
      chronologically, is concerned with a side issue which was not followed up.
      The author was experimenting for a character to act as the accomplice of
      Lord Braithwaite at the Hall; and he makes trial of the present personage,
      Mountford; of an Italian priest, Father Angelo; and finally of the
      steward, Omskirk, who is adopted. It will be noticed that Mountford is
      here endowed (for the moment) with the birthright of good Doctor Hammond,
      the Warden. He is represented as having made the journey to America in
      search of the grave. This alteration being inconsistent with the true
      thread of the story, and being, moreover, not continued, I have placed
      this passage in the Appendix, instead of in the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe often, in the dim weather, when the prophetic intimations of
      rain were too strong to allow an American to walk abroad with peace of
      mind, was in the habit of pacing this noble hall, and watching the process
      of renewal and adornment; or, which suited him still better, of enjoying
      its great, deep solitude when the workmen were away. Parties of visitors,
      curious tourists, sometimes peeped in, took a cursory glimpse at the old
      hall, and went away; these were the only ordinary disturbances. But, one
      day, a person entered, looked carelessly round the hall, as if its
      antiquity had no great charm to him; then he seemed to approach Redclyffe,
      who stood far and dim in the remote distance of the great room. The
      echoing of feet on the stone pavement of the hall had always an impressive
      sound, and turning his head towards the visitant Edward stood as if there
      were an expectance for him in this approach. It was a middle-aged man&mdash;rather,
      a man towards fifty, with an alert, capable air; a man evidently with
      something to do in life, and not in the habit of throwing away his moments
      in looking at old halls; a gentlemanly man enough, too. He approached
      Redclyffe without hesitation, and, lifting his hat, addressed him in a way
      that made Edward wonder whether he could be an Englishman. If so, he must
      have known that Edward was an American, and have been trying to adapt his
      manners to those of a democratic freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Redclyffe, I believe,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe bowed, with the stiff caution of an Englishman; for, with
      American mobility, he had learned to be stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have had the pleasure of knowing&mdash;at least of meeting&mdash;you
      very long ago,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;But I see you do not recollect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe confessed that the stranger had the advantage of him in his
      recollection of a previous acquaintance.

      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;for, as I have already hinted, it was many
      years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my own country then, of course,&rdquo; said Redclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your own country certainly,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;and when it would
      have required a penetrating eye to see the distinguished Mr. Redclyffe.
      the representative of American democracy abroad, in the little pale-faced,
      intelligent boy, dwelling with an old humorist in the corner of a
      graveyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Redclyffe sent back his recollections, and, though
      doubtfully, began to be aware that this must needs be the young Englishman
      who had come to his guardian on such a singular errand as to search an old
      grave. It must be he, for it could be nobody else; and, in truth, he had a
      sense of his identity,&mdash;which, however, did not express itself by
      anything that he could confidently remember in his looks, manner, or
      voice,&mdash;yet, if anything, it was most in the voice. But the image
      which, on searching, he found in his mind of a fresh-colored young
      Englishman, with light hair and a frank, pleasant face, was terribly
      realized for the worse in this somewhat heavy figure, and coarser face,
      and heavier eye. In fact, there is a terrible difference between the
      mature Englishman and the young man who is not yet quite out of his
      blossom. His hair, too, was getting streaked and sprinkled with gray; and,
      in short, there were evident marks of his having worked, and succeeded,
      and failed, and eaten and drunk, and being made largely of beef, ale,
      port, and sherry, and all the solidities of English life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you now,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, extending his hand frankly; and yet
      Mountford took it in so cold a way that he was immediately sorry that he
      had done it, and called up an extra portion of reserve to freeze the rest
      of the interview. He continued, coolly enough, &ldquo;I remember you, and
      something of your American errand,&mdash;which, indeed, has frequently
      been in my mind since. I hope you found the results of your voyage, in the
      way of discovery, sufficiently successful to justify so much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember,&rdquo; said Mountford, &ldquo;that the grave proved quite
      unproductive. Yes, you will not have forgotten it; for I well recollect
      how eagerly you listened, with that queer little girl, to my talk with the
      old governor, and how disappointed you seemed when you found that the
      grave was not to be opened. And yet, it is very odd. I failed in that
      mission; and yet there are circumstances that have led me to think that I
      ought to have succeeded better,&mdash;that some other person has really
      succeeded better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redclyffe was silent; but he remembered the strange old silver key, and
      how he had kept it secret, and the doubts that had troubled his mind then
      and long afterwards, whether he ought not to have found means to convey it
      to the stranger, and ask whether that was what he sought. And now here was
      that same doubt and question coming up again, and he found himself quite
      as little able to solve it as he had been twenty years ago. Indeed, with
      the views that had come up since, it behooved him to be cautious, until he
      knew both the man and the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are probably aware,&rdquo; continued Mountford,&mdash;&ldquo;for I understand you
      have been some time in this neighborhood,&mdash;that there is a pretended
      claim, a contesting claim, to the present possession of the estate of
      Braithwaite, and a long dormant title. Possibly&mdash;who knows?&mdash;you
      yourself might have a claim to one or the other. Would not that be a
      singular coincidence? Have you ever had the curiosity to investigate your
      parentage with a view to this point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The title,&rdquo; replied Redclyffe, &ldquo;ought not to be a very strong
      consideration with an American. One of us would be ashamed, I verily
      believe, to assume any distinction, except such as may be supposed to
      indicate personal, not hereditary merit. We have in some measure, I think,
      lost the feeling of the past, and even of the future, as regards our own
      lines of descent; and even as to wealth, it seems to me that the idea of
      heaping up a pile of gold, or accumulating a broad estate for our children
      and remoter descendants, is dying out. We wish to enjoy the fulness of our
      success in life ourselves, and leave to those who descend from us the task
      of providing for themselves. This tendency is seen in our lavish
      expenditure, and the whole arrangement of our lives; and it is slowly&mdash;yet
      not very slowly, either&mdash;effecting a change in the whole economy of
      American life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Mountford, with a smile that Redclyffe fancied was
      dark and subtle, &ldquo;still, I should imagine that even an American might
      recall so much of hereditary prejudice as to be sensible of some earthly
      advantages in the possession of an ancient title and hereditary estate
      like this. Personal distinction may suit you better,&mdash;to be an
      Ambassador by your own talent; to have a future for yourself, involving
      the possibility of ranking (though it were only for four years) among the
      acknowledged sovereigns of the earth;&mdash;this is very good. But if the
      silver key would open the shut up secret to-day, it might be possible that
      you would relinquish these advantages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Redclyffe could reply, (and, indeed, there seemed to be an allusion
      at the close of Mountford&rsquo;s speech which, whether intended or not, he knew
      not how to reply to,) a young lady entered the hall, whom he was at no
      loss, by the colored light of a painted window that fell upon her,
      translating her out of the common daylight, to recognize as the relative
      of the pensioner. She seemed to have come to give her fanciful
      superintendence to some of the decorations of the hall; such as required
      woman&rsquo;s taste, rather than the sturdy English judgment and antiquarian
      knowledge of the Warden. Slowly following after her came the pensioner
      himself, leaning on his staff and looking up at the old roof and around
      him with a benign composure, and himself a fitting figure by his antique
      and venerable appearance to walk in that old hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mountford, to Redclyffe&rsquo;s surprise, &ldquo;here is an acquaintance&mdash;two
      acquaintances of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved along the hall to accost them; and as he appeared to expect that
      Redclyffe would still keep him company, and as the latter had no reason
      for not doing so, they both advanced to the pensioner, who was now leaning
      on the young woman&rsquo;s arm. The incident, too, was not unacceptable to the
      American, as promising to bring him into a more available relation with
      her&mdash;whom he half fancied to be his old American acquaintance&mdash;than
      he had yet succeeded in obtaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my old friend,&rdquo; said Mountford, after bowing with a certain
      measured respect to the young woman, &ldquo;how wears life with you? Rather,
      perhaps, it does not wear at all; you being so well suited to the life
      around you, you grow by it like a lichen on a wall. I could fancy now that
      you have walked here for three hundred years, and remember when King James
      of blessed memory was entertained in this hall, and could marshal out all
      the ceremonies just as they were then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old man,&rdquo; said the pensioner, quietly, &ldquo;grows dreamy as he wanes away;
      and I, too, am sometimes at a loss to know whether I am living in the past
      or the present, or whereabouts in time I am,&mdash;or whether there is any
      time at all. But I should think it hardly worth while to call up one of my
      shifting dreams more than another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said Redclyffe, &ldquo;I shall find it impossible to call up this
      scene&mdash;any of these scenes&mdash;hereafter, without the venerable
      figure of this, whom I may truly call my benefactor, among them. I fancy
      him among them from the foundation,&mdash;young then, but keeping just the
      equal step with their age and decay,&mdash;and still doing good and
      hospitable deeds to those who need them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man seemed not to like to hear these remarks and expressions of
      gratitude from Mountford and the American; at any rate, he moved away with
      his slow and light motion of infirmity, but then came uneasily back,
      displaying a certain quiet restlessness, which Redclyffe was sympathetic
      enough to perceive. Not so the sturdier, more heavily moulded Englishman,
      who continued to direct the conversation upon the pensioner, or at least
      to make him a part of it, thereby bringing out more of his strange
      characteristics. In truth, it is not quite easy for an Englishman to know
      how to adapt himself to the line feelings of those below him in point of
      station, whatever gentlemanly deference he may have for his equals or
      superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like now, father pensioner,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to know how many steps
      you may have taken in life before your path led into this hole, and whence
      your course started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let him speak thus to the old man,&rdquo; said the young woman, in a
      low, earnest tone, to Redclyffe. He was surprised and startled; it seemed
      like a voice that has spoken to his boyhood.
    </p>

      <i>Note 2. Author&rsquo;s note</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Redclyffe&rsquo;s place is next to that of

    <h3>
      CHAP. XX.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Note 1.</i> This is not the version of the story as indicated in the
      earlier portion of the romance. It is there implied that Elsie is the
      Doctor&rsquo;s granddaughter, her mother having been the Doctor&rsquo;s daughter, who
      was ruined by the then possessor of the Braithwaite estates, and who died
      in consequence. That the Doctor&rsquo;s scheme of revenge was far deeper and
      more terrible than simply to oust the family from its possessions, will
      appear further on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Note 2.</i> The foregoing passage was evidently experimental, and the
      author expresses his estimate of its value in the following words,&mdash;&ldquo;What
      unimaginable nonsense!&rdquo; He then goes on to make the following memoranda as
      to the plot. It should be remembered, however, that all this part of the
      romance was written before the American part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half of a secret is preserved in England; that is to say, in the
      particular part of the mansion in which an old coffer is hidden; the other
      part is carried to America. One key of an elaborate lock is retained in
      England, among some old curiosities of forgotten purpose; the other is the
      silver key that Redclyffe found beside the grave. A treasure of gold is
      what they expect; they find a treasure of golden locks. This lady, the
      beloved of the Bloody Footstep, had been murdered and hidden in the coffer
      on account of jealousy. Elsie must know the baselessness of Redclyffe&rsquo;s
      claims, and be loath to tell him, because she sees that he is so much
      interested in them. She has a paper of the old Doctor&rsquo;s revealing the
      whole plot,&mdash;a death-bed confession; Redclyffe having been absent at
      the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reader will recollect that this latter suggestion was not adopted:
      there was no death-bed confession. As regards the coffer full of golden
      locks, it was suggested by an incident recorded in the &ldquo;English
      Note-Books,&rdquo; 1854. &ldquo;The grandmother of Mrs. O&rsquo;Sullivan died fifty years
      ago, at the age of twenty-eight. She had great personal charms, and among
      them a head of beautiful chestnut hair. After her burial in a family tomb,
      the coffin of one of her children was laid on her own, so that the lid
      seems to have decayed, or been broken from this cause; at any rate, this
      was the case when the tomb was opened, about a year ago. The grandmother&rsquo;s
      coffin was then found to be filled with beautiful, glossy, living chestnut
      ringlets, into which her whole substance seems to have been transformed,
      for there was nothing else but these shining curls, the growth of half a
      century, in the tomb. An old man, with a ringlet of his youthful mistress
      treasured in his heart, might be supposed to witness this wonderful
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      CHAP. XXIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Note 1.</i> In a study of the plot, too long to insert here, this new
      character of the steward is introduced and described. It must suffice to
      say, in this place, that he was intimately connected with Dr. Grimshawe,
      who had resuscitated him after he had been hanged, and had thus gained his
      gratitude and secured his implicit obedience to his wishes, even twenty
      years after his (Grimshawe&rsquo;s) death. The use the Doctor made of him was to
      establish him in Braithwaite Hall as the perpetual confidential servant of
      the owners thereof. Of course, the latter are not aware that the steward
      is acting in Grimshawe&rsquo;s interest, and therefore in deadly opposition to
      their own. Precisely what the steward&rsquo;s mission in life was, will appear
      here-after.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study above alluded to, with others, amounting to about a hundred
      pages, will be published as a supplement to a future edition of this work.
    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAP. XXIV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Note 1. Author&rsquo;s note</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Redclyffe lies in a dreamy state,
      thinking fantastically, as if he were one of the seven sleepers. He does
      not yet open his eyes, but lies there in a maze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Note 2. Author&rsquo;s note</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Redclyffe must look at the old man
      quietly and dreamily, and without surprise, for a long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Note 3.</i> Presumably the true name of Doctor Grimshawe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Note 4.</i> This mysterious prisoner, Sir Edward Redclyffe, is not, of
      course, the Sir Edward who founded the Hospital, but a descendant of that
      man, who ruined Doctor Grimshawe&rsquo;s daughter, and is the father of Elsie.
      He had been confined in this chamber, by the Doctor&rsquo;s contrivance, ever
      since, Omskirk being his jailer, as is foreshadowed in Chapter XL He has
      been kept in the belief that he killed Grimshawe, in a struggle that took
      place between them; and that his confinement in the secret chamber is
      voluntary on his own part,&mdash;a measure of precaution to prevent arrest
      and execution for murder. In this miserable delusion he has cowered there
      for five and thirty years. This, and various other dusky points, are
      partly elucidated in the notes hereafter to be appended to this volume.
    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAP. XXV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Note 1.</i> At this point, the author, for what reason I will not
      venture to surmise, chooses to append this gloss: &ldquo;Bubble-and-Squeak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Note 2. Author&rsquo;s note</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;They found him in the hall, about to
      go out.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
